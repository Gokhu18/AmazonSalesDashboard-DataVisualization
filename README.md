# AmazonSalesDashboard-DataVisualization
Aim of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data over a period and create a visualization dashboard which helps business users to draw key insights. Often Ecommerce companies assess their business trends in various sales segments and make decisions with the help of results from sophisticated visualization platforms. We analyzed the data obtained from the Amazon product metadata, transactions dataset to produce some interactive visualization using D3.js, HighCharts.js and AnyCharts.js to show summarized results over the years. SentenTree is a new novel visualization tool used for visualizing unstructured data like tweets is applied in context of user reviews and results are observed.
