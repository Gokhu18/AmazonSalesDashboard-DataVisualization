359	I found this newer version of Little Women almost as wonderful as the older version. I loved the fact that they still kept the scenes quite snowey and the "era" very intact. It got a little long winded in a few scenes but the movie on a whole was very well done and moved along with the story.If you are a Little Women fan you will fall in love with this new version as well. Enjoy!	4
360	The DVD I ordered came as promised and in good condition. However, the plastic it was wrapped in was all dusty and got some dust inside the DVD case. Then again, it was an older movie from the 90's probably stored somewhere for a while.	1
361	I loved this movie as a child and I still love it! I'm happy to have found it! I can't wait to share it with my daughter.	6
362	Not only is this film centered on the lives of four amazing women, the men are classy. They remind me of my family except we are Africans. I love that Jo finds someone who she is compatible with. No offense to Laurie, but she is better off with the professor. Great female movie. It made me proud to be a female. I also love that it is family-oriented. It was made very well, and will stand the test of time. One more thing, in addition to the main characters who clearly also loved their mother, there's a small father-daughter theme--the man who dashed Beth his daughter's piano, which is terrific. Two more things, they have good manners in this film, which is wonderful and they dressed them up really well. I love this movie so much.	1
363	Deep in the heart of Women lie secrets that we men will no more discover than a treasure chest in our back yard, yet despite that fact after seeing this film, I had a new understanding about the jewels women possess internally. Wynona Ryder, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado, and Kirsten Dunst, play four sisters(Joe, Beth, Meg, and Amy) that live the role's of fantasy within a hardened reality.  Due to the tumultuous force of the Civil War, their family has fallen from a pedistol in society to the grand standing heights of togetherness and warmth within the means of their own spirits. Their father rages on the battle-front while Marmee (Susan Sarandon) keeps tight her little women from the casualties of daily life. Little Women inspired me in all ways that my emotions would allow, while all the while Thomas Newman's soundtracks gently guides you through the steps of their failures, triumphs, and hysteric's.  After countless viewings (35-55) it has stood against the test of time that sometimes fades the impact a movie creates. After 7 years Little Women still fascinates me as much as it did on my first viewing. Love, distrust, death, and creativity, within these, their bond's of family strength hold them.  There are lesson's to be learned if we are willing to open our own hearts to them. To our friends, Loves, and families, there is something to be gathered from these little women. That lesson is the importance of togetherness.  ~S.A.O.S.~	5
364	Anyone who loved the book will enjoy this movie just for the dazzling color roadshow of one's favorite scenes ("the Pickwick Club," etc.)  It would have had to be a miniseries a la ANNE OF GREEN GABLES to really be true to the book, but it was lovely to see so many favorites so rousingly played.Others have complained about the 1990s refraction of the story.  They're right, but Alcott probably wouldn't have minded.  I was able to overlook most of that.However, Claire Danes was so miscast I was unable to let go and really enjoy the film whenever she was in a scene.  Beth is supposed to be slight and physically fragile -- strapping Claire Danes looks like she's captain of her field hockey team!  Danes works hard at the character but she can't escape the sheer wrongness of her physical self.  She appears larger and stronger than any of her sisters or Marmee!  Thus instead of seeming competent, but shy and reserved, her Beth seems slightly retarded.	10
365	packege as discribed - highly recommend seller to all parties - was well priced within the market.  I love these older movies and find they relax me to sleep LOL which is a good thing I promise/	6
366	This movie is abousluty the best i first saw it when i was little a loved it its best i mad my mom reanted about 5 times then she finally brought it for me it is the best gret for ppl ages 1-100	2
367	Watched it with my wife (she begged and I felt obliged) and I enjoyed it. I'm a real man if it helps for those debating at the moment whether they will lose some masculinity watching this.	6
368	This is one of my favorite books and I love this movie.  Other versions are great with Katherine Hepburn and Liz Taylor but something about the cast with this movie makes it my fav version!	6
369	It broke while I was trying to get it out of the package, which was like breaking into Ft. Knox.	3
370	This one of tge greatest classics there are.  If you need a pick up or a good cheer, this is a great one to do it. Full of love, hope and determination.	6
371	I love this movie overall because it features some very famous actors and actresses, but because it is a well-made version of a classic tale. Little Women is enjoyable over and over and again, and I just had to have it!	2
372	This is a great interpretation of the classic book.  It sticks pretty close to the original story, and the actresses play the March girls so well.  I was afraid this wouldn't be that good because the book is such a well-loved classic, but I was happily wrong about that.	2
373	I love all the actresses portrayals of the characters and feel they really brought them to life. Casting was dead on and made it even more enjoyable.	6
374	Beautiful music, cinematography, wonderful story! There were three movies made based on the book by Louisa May Alcott, they are all great movies but I love this one!	6
375	Family friendly.  The movie has a love interest, a conflict, and a resolution.  But it still has an element of surprise.  I loved it.	6
376	My 12 year old had read the book and never saw the movie so we rented it on amazon she loved it and so did I of course it was actullay exactly like the book. Highly recomend.	6
377	Little Women has become my families favorite movie. My 2 sons 11 & 6, as well as my 3 year old daughter absolutely adore this movie. It is a story of generousity in times of hardship and shows the value of holding tight to your family. Jo definately steals the show with her unrequeted love/friendship with Lawri.	1
378	I have never read the book, OK?  But the film has become one of our perrineal Christmas favorites.  The movie is a visual feast of real, or simulated New England autumns and winters.  The soundtrack is an orchestral treat that is rich and moving. Susan Sarandon does manage to inject Marmie with a certain self-righteous, leftist, feminist, scolding quality, but overall, wholesome family themes win out.  Each time we watch this film, it's even better than we remembered it.	3
379	There were several things I found terribly jarring about this film, points at which I was not sure if I was viewing a film version of this classic tale or merely someone's political viewpoint showing through a fine veneer of Alcott's story. The beginning, which in the book shows the personality of the sisters through their conversation, is neglected. Winona Ryder isn't the best Jo- too pretty and piquant. They needed someone with more spirit, someone perhaps a little plainer. Claire Danes didn't work out as Beth, either-too tall and with too deep a voice. They needed someone smaller, and more timid looking. Kirsten Dunst made a good Amy, but I wanted a more clear transition to Mathis than was portrayed. Also, why all the feminist lines put into Marmee's mouth? And why the cutting out of nearly every mention of God when the Marches were devout Christians-Mr. March was a minister, for crying out loud! And Meg's declination of the silk dress because of the workers in China-come on, everyone who's read the book knows Meg wanted a silk dress. Too many important scenes were skipped, and the relationship between Jo and the Professor is not what it was in the book. Overall a very disappointing adaptation. I reccomend the Katherine Hepburn version.	40
380	This movie's setting in Concord Massachusetts and that little place has such incredible historical significance.  This movie is not only entertaining but educational as well.  I am so glad that my 11 year old enjoyed it along with me.	6
381	Winona Ryder made the best &#34;Jo&#34; of any of the past Little Women movies.Watching this movie made me want to read the book again.	1
382	Winona Ryder was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Jo March and after you watch it, you can fully appreciate the intensity and vulnerability of her performance.  While Jo is the heart of the story, this is an ensemble movie with some of the best actors alive.  Kirsten Dunst simply shines as Amy, so much so that it is a disappointment when the second act roles around and she is replaced by the far less competent Samantha Manthis, who does not look like an older Kirsten Dunset at all.  But Gabriel Byrne, the always-fascinating Christian Bale, Claire Danes, and Susan Sarandon more than make up for it.I was only slightly disappointed by the director's commentary.  Most of what she had to say was interesting and I truly enjoy the process of film-making, but she seemed to drag in some places, along with her commentary on the two deleted scenes and why they were deleted.But the film itself captures the spirit of the novel in every way-- its music, its costuming, its art direction.  It makes one long for the time when the English language was written and spoken as it is in Little Women.	6
383	For me, `Little Women' has this layer of pedestrianism that makes it feel so vanilla and far too middlebrow to be anything remarkable.  Despite some very nice performances and some beautiful imagery, there is little impact made by the glossy film.  It just kind of sits there.  The story is one full of drama and tension and yet none of that is effectively conveyed.  It just feels so rudimentary, with no real life blood.  Still, the central performances are nice, especially the supporting turns by Claire Danes (my one moment of tear induced connection) and Christian Bale (so loose and relaxed and energetic).  The sad thing is that the film carries a veneer of stiffness or mugginess.  I have not read the book, so I cannot compare there (although devoted fans of the book have claimed this film veers.  I like the movie, and it is a wonderful film for families and one that your little girls will love, but at the end of the day there is nothing special about this rather mundane interpretation of a classic.	6
384	Blah.  If Christian Bale is in it, why is it not more like the Dark Night Trilogy? Very disappointed in this film, nothing like Batman at all.	3
385	I used to watch this when I was a little girl and dont have VHS anymore, so, I bought this DVD and was totally satisfied. I found it in my mail box on the exact date that was estimated, brand new, and played perfectally in my DVD player. I recomend this seller for all based on honesty, dependability, and the fact that the price was very reasonable. Thank you!	6
386	I'm having my 4 & 5 year old watch classic movies and then we're reading the books and the 5 year old loved it.  My 4 year old got a bit bored, but did pretty well overall.	1
387	Ive always enjoyed the movie. I was tickled pink to get it on my kindle. Now I can watch it anywhere in piece and quiet (kids) with my earbuds.	6
388	Very much enjoyed this DVD.  The acting was superb, and the plot was good.  Also liked the filming - beautiful scenes.	1
389	Great for a mommy daughter night!	6
390	To start out, this is one of my favorite books. So I of course started out with an additude to begin with, muttering that the book was always better. In this case, I was so wrong. The characters portrayed in this film are the same ones I met in 5th grade when I first read "Little Women". The actors shine in their roles and truly embody everyone one of the literary creations they represents.Playing the March matriarch, Susan Sarandon is great! She is able to maintain the feel of the period while bringing to Marmee an empowering bout of women's rights thoughts. Sarandon gives off warmth and knowledge wiht the apparent ease of someone completely familiar with the material.Wynona Ryder is another standout here. She is the raging bundle of emotion that we have all come to know as Jo March. Playing down her usually unique features, Ryder plays the part with spunk and earnestness.My favorite here is Christian Bale as the oft put uopn Theodore "Laurie" Lawrence. Quite a jump from his "Newsies" days, Bale is the best Laurie I have seen on screen to date. He has the mannerisms and lines down to perfection, while still maintaining the spontanaity that really is a huge part of Laurie's character. He also handles the age jump incredibly well.Not until my most recent viewing of the movie did I realize Gabriel Byrne was Professor Bhaer. The native irishman does a great job of bringing Frerdrick to life, right down to his physical bumbling and poetic heart.In my opinion, this movie was a complete triumph and a complete success from novel to film. All actors are fine in their roles, most exceptional, and it is such a joy to see an old favorite and all-time classic brought to life which such enthusiasm and talent. This is a must-see for any fan of the novel~although it will leave you yearning for "Little Men" and Jo's Boys" featuring this cast-which has yet to be done!!	57
391	I wish it would have more prominently stated that this DVD is in PAL format and will not play on most U.S. DVD players.	2
392	The book that Louisa May Alcott wrote touched us all, and now the movie is even better. It's a heartwarming family movie, that is now my favorite. I recommend every one see it. I believe it will touch you.	1
393	A brilliant cast (just look at the cover) coming alive in lushly filmed settings wrapped around an old favorite make this a success. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is its puzzling modernized philosophies, which were not in the book and serve as somewhat preachy distractions.Other than this, the movie remains faithful to the book in a rare, loving way. The first-rate cast adds depth and feeling to their roles. Each of the characters we wanted to emulate or lose our hearts to, as children who loved the book, comes fully alive here, imperfections and all.Will you need hankies? Yes, for many reasons. This is a movie to curl up with and watch over again. And I do.	6
394	This is a sensitive and exquisite remake of the timeless classic.  Certainly better in every respect than any earlier version that I've seen. Unlike some earlier versions, it is robust, deeply engaging and fully satisfying.  This movie delivers Louisa May Alcott's novel to new generations.  Roger Ebert was right when he praised the film as &#34;surprisingly sharp and intelligent.&#34;  This is absolutely the case.  Winona Ryder's radiant and appealing portrayal of Jo is the very heart of the film, but all the cast is superb.  Susan Sarandon is flawless as the mother of the family; Kirsten Dunst is delightful as little Amy; Claire Danes gives a heartrending portrayal of Beth; but all the sisters are marvelously portrayed; Christian Bale as the neighbor Laurie is lovable and endearing; Eric Stolz is memorable as Laurie's tutor, and Gabriel Byrne is perfect, absolutely perfect,  in his role as the wise and gentle German professor Jo meets in New York, who becomes a a mentor and friend.  This is a wonderful film to watch during the holiday season.  If you've been disappointed in overly sweet Christmas films, take a chance on this one.  The production values are high throughout and even if you know nothing of Alcott or the novel, &#34;Little Women,&#34; this film may likely engage you and delight you.  I saw nothing in this film that would date it, though it is now almost twenty years old.  On the contrary, I think it's destined to be a classic.  DVDs would make great gifts for Christmas.	14
395	This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It's one of those movies that I just haven't bought yet because it's so special and I don't want to over watch it.  But when ever I just am fealing like I need to see a good movie, something that I love, it comes on TV and so I watch it and it makes me feal good cause after I've watched it I've cried a little, I've smiled a little, been a little bitter that Christian Bale falls in love with Winona Ryder and not me, and in the end everyone seems so happy.  You just get so involved with the lives of these &quot;Little women&quot;  it just makes you feal so good inside and warm.  I love this, and now that it is out on DVD I think I am going to buy it to add to my collection to make sure I have it for all time. I reccomend this movie for people who love sweet movies that make you feal good on a rainy day.  It is great!  An all time favorite!	3
396	I know Wynona Ryder is an acclaimed actress, but she doesn't fit the part. She had no passion in her lines, good lines. Jo's personality in this film adaption is portrayed as selfish and terribly angry most of the time. The character in these woman aren't shown effectively, which causes a disconnect between the viewer and the story. Jo's ambitious side is witnessed very cleary, I will give that credit. Although the relationship between Jo and Beth isn't depicted enough as a caring one and doesn't clarify why Jo is very sad when Beth dies. Also, there is a mistake when Jo writes her novel at the end, it's not named "Little Woman", but "My Beth".The father isn't played enough as a central part of why the girls have morals and character. The mother (whoever acts her) doesn't act very well as a caring and loving person, rather she says her lines without any emotion.Although, I will give the reason as to why I rated it two stars instead of one. They showed the reluctance on Amy's part to become friends with Theodore Lawrence, which is understandable because he just broke off with her sister. But they didn't make clear why "Teddy" all of a sudden likes Amy. I would recommend the 1932 version for its portrayal of Jo and the love between her and her sisters and the father's role, although it too doesn't clarify why "Teddy" (or "Laurie") likes Amy all of a sudden.	9
397	I had always wanted to read the book growing up but never got to. Loved this version of the movie.	6
398	It didn't come as fast as it said, but I did receive it and my wife loves the movie.movie.	6
399	I was just sad that Hollywood butchered the book so badly. You don't love the characters as you do in the book. Wynonna Ryder is not endearing at all, I felt like I was watching her exact same character who was pretending in "Mr. Deeds". It is not faithful to the book especially in some of the most important and endearing parts! Sad to watch if you love the book, but I guess that goes with most movie portrayals of great books.  Disappointed :(	5
400	Everyone involved in this beautiful film brings together a story that feels more like a sweet melancholy melody than a dramatic story. If you love this movie, please also purchase the soundtrack CD which is wonderful listening.	1
401	If you think this M ovoe it's your fault that you cant understand it. This was the best movie, and unlike most movies based on books it was reallistic. The carecters where loveble and the moive made it feel like you  where in their world. The first time me and my sister saw this movie it was  when we woke uup at 2 in the morning and couldent get to sleep, every night  for the next week we snook down stairs to watch the movie. WATCH THIS  MOVIE!	4
402	I have loved this movie since I was young and I'm so excited to now have it on DVD and watch it anytime!	6
403	Others have written praising the updating of this classic story.  I found the updating sad and came away sorry that this film of the book kept the original title.  The new movie imposes modern liberal and feminist values on the old story and rips out the simple christian goodness that made the classic shine.I will agree with other reviewers that the new version is beautifully executed, but the simple joy and goodness of the book was left out.	41
404	I was very impressed by this interpretation of Little Women. While the 1949 version is nearly a word-for-word remake of the 1932 version, this production took a new look at the script and as a result the characters have more depth and the background of events, attitudes, and living conditions is more accurately and thoroughly portrayed.	2
405	My family of boys and girls loves this family classic.  We can sit and watch it anytime and remember that the most important things are under your own roof.	1
406	This is a truly heart warming story of four sisters turning from children into &quot;little women&quot; durung the 1860s. It's as good if not better than the novel. They let you in in their joys and hardships. Winona Ryder is truly amazing as Jo, and seems to capture her character perfectly. It's  a also a very good proformance by Christian Bale as Laurie, the boy next  door. He makes it seem as though he really is Theodore Lawrence.	1
407	A simple but well constructed story of an era gone by.  Family life is depicted with a strong mother influence since the father was away at war.  Her values supported and led her daughters through difficult times.	6
408	Another of my favorite movies and just had to add this one to my collection! I know that you will love it, too!	6
409	This was a great thing. I am so happy that I got it. It is a great movie I love.	6
410	This film is nothing short of superb.  Susan Sarandon is flawless as Marmie, and Winona Ryder is an excellent Jo.  Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the professor.  The period settings and costumes are authentic (I'm a history teacher) without romanticizing days gone by.  Best of all is the film's feminist sensibility.  Some have criticized this as a modern overlay on a book from another era, but Louisa May Alcott was very much a feminist; in the Victorian world for which she wrote, it was necessary to soft-pedal her ideas.  The film brings them to center stage.	6
411	I love watching this movie with my grandma who is 89 years old and will be 90 this September.me and her also love the books too.the movie is one of the best movies I've have ever seen and I really enjoy watching it with her and by myself too. I got this movie down in florida last year for a 1dollar and it's in great condition too. I would love to time travel back to that time and see what it was like to grown up then.i love old fashion movies and books too.my grandma and me watch it last year in florida with my dad too. he didn't enjoy it like me and my grandma did.i can relate to all of the girls and I don't have a favorite there all my favorite.in florida it's was me and my grandma first time seeing the movie and we both love it dearly.i bought her the books for her birthday and she enjoy them so much.i also bought me the books to and I'm re-reading them again for the 5th time.my grandma read the books when she was a child but never own the books until last year.the movie is the most wonderful movie I've ever seen and I've seen so many movies.i would say if you love the books and want to see the movie then pick this one.to me the girls where meant to play these girls.i would love to meet Louisa may Alcott and just sit with her and talk and other stuff. if you love the movie then read the books.the books are little women,little men and jo's boys in that order.i love to read and watch movies but this is my favorite movie and also my favorite book series too.	6
412	I can't believe this movie got good reviews!  They destroyed to book!  Whatever you do, do not read the book again before watching this movie.....it will make you feel frustrated with the butchering of the characters and dialogue.  I'm sure if I had never read the book the movie would be delightful but having read the book, if I had been the author I would feel sickened by what was done to the characters:/	6
413	One thing you all should know: There was a "novelization" of this Armstrong movie.  Yes, a "book" of about 110 pages, which followed the movie exactly.  Many people bought this "book", thinking they were getting Alcott's Little Women!  No wonder so many reviewers here think this movie followed the book!All four movie versions have their advantages.  The Hepburn version has, well, Hepburn.  Everything else about that movie was bad.The same filmmakers had another go at it in 1949 with an all-star cast, in color with the superb Mervyn Leroy directing and delightful music.  And most importantly, it is true to the spirit of the Alcott novel.The BBC took a whack at it in 1973.  Three and a half hours, so it has more of the book, but even they couldn't abide the homespun wisdom of Marmee and substituted feminist advice circa 1970 for the advice Marmee gives Meg (very different from the feminist advice in the present version).  (Too bad.  Read the book's advice someday.  It could save many a modern marriage.)And now, this version.  Others have said how it throws the book away, changes all the characters, etc. etc.  Of course, Winona is adorable in whatever role she appears, and she and the scenery almost save this movie.Bottom line: if you're going to see only one, get the 1949 version.  And read the book--the Louisa May Alcott book (all 800 pages of it).  Otherwise, rent them before deciding.	19
414	LOVED this one! Even though I always imagined Jo not as pretty as she is in this movie, this was an excellent movie!	6
415	I first saw this version of Little Women years and years ago, when I was staying home from school with the flu. My mom had bought it, and she left it out for me to watch. I fell in love with it, and have since learned the entire movie word for word.I've never read the book, but I know that I would most likely enjoy it.It's appropriate for absoloutely any age level, and the costumes and sets are extremely accurate to the period. I would highly reccomend this film to anyone and everyone!So stop reading reviews and buy it! You will not regret it.	6
416	Don't listen to people who criticize this film for all the "overt" feminist overtones.  First of all, SINCE WHEN IS THAT A BAD THING?  One of the underlying problems many young readers have with the novel is its cozy acceptance of the Angel in the House doctrine.  But secondly, it is NOT completely out of spirit with the book.  Alcott was herself a proponent of women's rights.  She wrote the novel to make money, and was pressured by her publishers to tack on Part II (and further novels, like "Little Men").  Furthermore, many critics can EASILY pick out 19th century pro-feminist movement (a.k.a. New Woman) thoughts and episodes in the book.  Jo's very character is very New Woman.  The fact that the girls can only express themselves artistically whilst posing as men says a great deal about what Alcott is trying to express to us, in the guise of a "safe" novel for young female readers.The film is simply excellent.  The acting is fantastic; four actors playing the March sisters do a tremendous job, and Bale as Laurie is perfect.  Even the Professor is made more likable!  The film politely leaves off the fact that Jo is going to open a school for BOYS.  I was appreciative of the decision; it seems to chip away at her character in the book.	2
417	I felt I was missing something thoughout this whole movie. I haven't run across anyone who doesn't regard it as a classic or a masterpiece that tugs at their heart strings...but I just didn't feel it.It feels too much like a movie...too much drama, too much music, and too many colorful costumes. I know it's a movie, but when I watch movies I usually am not thinking: "movie, movie movie" throughout the whole thing.Not one of my favorites. I like the book this is loosely based on better.	3
418	Most everyone who knows me knows that I am obsessed with Little Women.  It is my favorite book (I don't dare to review THAT because I know I will rant on and on about its awesomeness and bore everyone to tears), I wrote all my college essays about its impact on me and I've read it about three or four times a year since I was nine, so I may be a bit biased in saying this is the best film I've ever seen, but hear me out...First of all, I think the casting was almost perfect, especially with Winona Ryder as Jo, Christian Bale as Laurie, and Susan Sarandon as Marmee (though I was somewhat traumatized after I saw her in the Rocky Horror Picture Show a few years after I first viewed this film): they were very believable in their roles and they made me laugh, listen carefully to their words of wisdom, and cry when they experienced hardship.  Secondly, the plot moves fast but doesn't miss capturing the spirit of the scenes that echo those from the book (ex: Jo's anger after discovering Amy has burned her manuscript).  Thirdly, the necessity of deleting some of the book's content carried out by the film makers didn't seem off-putting at all to me -- very few scenes that I really admired were passed over. Fourth, the edition of new content was enjoyable (Ex: couples kissing tenderly or passionately rather than hinting darkly of romance in such a way that the reader doesn't always know how far the feelings run -- one thing that always bothered me was the lack of courtship between John and Meg before she accepted his proposal: she seemed to enjoy rejecting him too much at first to have feelings rooted too deep at that point): Louisa May Alcott's book was largely autobiographical and she based Jo off of her own experiences, so the idea of having this Jo write her experiences into a novel entitled Little Women seemed perfect in my eyes.I see that some reviewers seem to prefer the earlier adaptations of the novel: personally this is the only one I've ever seen, though if I had a chance (or the funds) to get my hands on the others I'd snap them up in a second: hard to imagine the film any better, but I am totally open to possibilities.	6
419	This film is the best Little Women film to date! Claire Danes was not the best Beth, but very enchanting. Winona Ryder did a superb job as Jo. Kirsten Dunst was very funny and enchanting as young Amy. Susan Sarandon was wonderful as Marmee.	2
420	I am watching the ending of the movie right now as I write this. I have seen this version of Little Women many times over the years since it's release. I always loved this movie.  Now having my own lovely marriage and family, I find the story and this movie to be deep in meaning.Love and joy in the family are timeless themes. It's something that binds all of us no matter what century the story is written and the reader/viewer lives.	6
421	This movie is a classic for me. One of my all time favorite movies!! I watch it every year around the holidays for sure.	6
422	This rates as one of my all-time favorite movies--very well done-actors are perfect for the parts--and the story is timeless-- love, loss, strong family bonds and wonderful life lessons!  I have watched it many times- great family movie!	6
423	I saw this version on "Little Women" shortly after reading the book, and was pleased with how well it followed the book.  True, the screenplay did invoke a little modern feminism, but there was a feminist movement during the 1860's; it was called the suffragette movement.  The Marches were transcendentalists, and as such, were greatly involved with all of the social issues of the day including child labor and rights of women and blacks.  Knowing this, I did not have a problem with some of the liberties taken by the screenwriter.  I feel this adaptation of "Little Women" was much more faithful to the book than the Katharine Hepburn/Janet Leigh version.  That version seemed to center mostly on the girls fighting for the affections of Laurie, which was really a minor plot line in the book.  The older version also made Marmee into a fretting, hand-wringing worrywart instead of the truly courageous woman that she was.  This version of "Little Women" was beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, and beatifully scored.  I can't pick a favorite performance, although I am a bit partial to Winona Ryder and Christian Bale, the latter playing a flawless Laurie, and the former inhabiting the very spirit of Jo March.  I've seen this movie many times and cry at about half of the scenes.  This gorgeous movie never grows old, the mark of a truly great movie.	7
424	I watched previous versions of this movie when I was a kid, it is truly my favorite version, I can't even remember how many times I have watched it.	6
425	i was excited to get this movie because its one of my favorites, but when i opened it, it was a used product and there were fingerprints all over it. i was kind of bummed.	6
426	Little Women is based on the 1868 book by Louisa May Alcott, that was in turn based on her own family and sisters. Alcott was a daughter of noted Transcendentalist Amos Bronson Alcott and Abigail May Alcott. She had three sisters: one elder (Anna Alcott Pratt) and two younger (Elizabeth Sewall Alcott and Abigail May Alcott Nieriker). The family moved to Boston in 1834 or 1835 where her father established an experimental school and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.Transcendentalism was a group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that emerged in New England in the early to middle 19th century. Transcendentalism began as a protest against the general state of culture and society at the time. Among transcendentalists' core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions. The best known work coming out of this movement was Thoreau's Walden; or Life in the Woods. Walden Pond itself is shown in Little Women in a scene where young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) is ice skating and falls in it. Talk about your skating on thin ice...Jo March (Winona Ryder) is the second oldest sister, and she is clearly the one modeled after Louisa May Alcott herself. She is an aspiring writer who writes stories and plays that the sisters act out. This is a perfect vehicle for Winona Ryder, whose own unconventional upbringing and alternative views on private property are mirrored by the March family:Josephine 'Jo' March: If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement, then I say the Marches must be the most elegant family in Concord!Amy March is played by two actresses, as in the first part she is just a child (a young Kirsten Dunst), but later she grows up to be a painter (Samantha Mathis). The young Amy is quite a scene stealer, and like Sheridan's Mrs. Malaprop, she sometimes makes up or misuses words, to comic effect:Younger Amy March: We've been expectorating you for hours!Meanwhile, scion of the prosperous Laurence family, and therefore known as Laurie (Christian Bale), wonders aloud to his tutor (Eric Stolz) what exactly transpires within the neighbors' cloistered household:John Brooke: Over the mysteries of female life there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.But young Laurie can't really leave the veil undisturbed, try as he might:Jo: [as Jo and Laurie dance awkwardly at Belle Gardner's ball] I'm sorry! Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home! It's a shame you don't know the lady's part!At one point, there is an epidemic of scarlet fever, and Amy is sent away to live with relatives to escape exposure:Amy: I don't wanna die. I've never even been kissed. I've waited my whole to be kissed, and what if I miss it?Laurie: I tell you what. I promise to kiss you before you die.Though he becomes very close to them all, he is in love with Jo. But it is complicated, as she has him firmly ensconsed in the friend bag.Laurie: I have loved you since the moment I clamped eyes on you. What could be more reasonable than to marry you?Jo March: We'd kill each other.Laurie: Nonsense!Jo March: Neither of us can keep our temper-...Laurie: I can, unless provoked.Jo March: We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you. We'd only quarrel!Laurie: I wouldn't!Jo March: You can't even propose without quarreling.He isn't going to take that without a fight, or a quarrel, more like it:Laurie: Someday you'll find a man, a good man, and you'll love him, and marry him, and live and die for him. And I'll be hanged if I stand by and watch.Jo is unsatisfied with her life and so Marmee March (Susan Sarandon) (and who better to play such a role?), marvelous matriarch of the March menangerie, sends her off:Marmee March: Oh, Jo. Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts; how can you expect to lead an ordinary life? You're ready to go out and - and find a good use for your talent. Tho' I don't know what I shall do without my Jo. Go, and embrace your liberty. And see what wonderful things come of it.In New York she meets a lot of interesting people foremost of whom is a handsome professor from Germany, Friedrich Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne). He takes her to see Georges Bizet's opera The Pearl Fishers, and while sitting in their vantage point perched high in the rafters backstage he translates for her:Friedrich: Your heart understood mine. In the depth of the fragrant night, I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice. Your heart understood mine.Of course though he is merely translating the opera, the words are also meant for Jo as well. He is a professor of philosophy, and he encourages her writing, but he feels like she is capable of more. When shown some of her work intended for a commercial audience he tells her so:Friedrich: [having read Jo's latest book] There is *nothing* in this of the woman I am privileged to know.He may be on to something. Jo is quite bursting with inspiration:Jo: Late At night my mind would come alive with voices and stories and friends as dear to me as any in the real world. I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.More professorial advice:Friedrich Bhaer: You must write from the depths of your soul!Meanwhile Amy goes off to Europe with Aunt March to study painting. Laurie is also there, studying music, and the two meet:Amy: Have you heard from Jo? She has befriended a German professor.Laurie: I envy her happiness. I envy his happiness. I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg. I hate Fred Vaughn. And if Beth had a lover I would despise him too. Just as you have always known that you would never marry a pauper, I have always known that I belong to the March family.Amy: I will not be loved for my family...It is complictated, isn't it? As Professor Bhaer tells Jo while watching the opera:Jo: What's going to happen?Friedrich: The inevitable.I thought I wasn't going to be able to enjoy this movie as it is intended for children, and female ones at that, but it was very entertaining. I wondered if some of the political issues had been shoehorned in by Winona and Sarandon, but looking into the background of author Alcott, those elements would have been there in the original book if Alcott had the freedoms we enjoy today. It is a prime example of where a story works on two levels simultaneously, with something for the kids, but also something for adults to ponder. Great period costumes and lush cinematography, especially the winter New England tableau. Interesting to see a young Kirsten Dunst, before Spiderman, as well as Christian Bale before he donned the Batman cape and cowl. As an interesting aside, there is a movie of the next book in the March family saga, Little Men. Here the character of Friedrich Bhaer was played by Christopher Sarandon, who divorced Susan but she kept his last name since then.The Alcott family reminded me a bit of The Bront sisters, who used to write their own little books and dramas, and then went on to produce such classic works of fiction as Charlotte Bront's Jane Ayre and Emily Bront's superb Wuthering Heights.The film is dedicated to two persons, one of whom is Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped from her Petaluma, California, home in 1993 and later found murdered. Winona Ryder, much of whose youth was spent in Petaluma, joined in the highly publicized search effort and made a number of emotional appeals for the child's safe return. Little Women was Polly's favorite book.Films of Susan SarandonDead Man Walking(1995) .... Sister Helen PrejeanThelma & Louise(1991) .... LouisePretty Baby(1978) ....

427	Okay, it's a bit schmaltzy, and steeped in our modern views--some of which Alcott shared, but couldn't print--but it's a reasonable interpretation of the book.  I thought the casting was very good, and Susan Sarandon did a particularly fine job as Marmee.  The most outstanding part of this production is that it succeeds in making John Brooke interesting, Professor Bhaer sexy, and the Professor and Jo's romance believable.  Much as I enjoy the book, I think Alcott failed on those last points.	6
428	Some flaws in casting choices perhaps: As a character study of Jo's development as a writer, Winona's portrayal is not very plausible.  A girl with a just ordinary personality, she seems like  "the girl nextdoor."  The actress who plays Beth doesn't look right for the delicate frailty of facial features that would give more appropriate impression of sensitive and shy Beth's character.  As acted here, adult Amy turns out to be the strongest and deepest character emotionally and the most likely candidate for star (or main character) of the show--which, really, Jo is supposed to be.Whether or not Winona Ryder or Katherine Hepburn (in an older version of the story) was most truly like the real-life Louisa Alcott is beyond my knowledge, but I find Katherine Hepburn's past portrayal of "Jo" to be more memorable and deeper than Winona's.  I remember the Hepburn movie as having greater dramatic unity, probably because of the stronger focus upon the character of Jo (and less on her sisters) in the unraveling of the plot.  The same was true in the 1942 version of the movie which starred June Alyson and Liz Taylor.  Jo was definitely the main focus there, too.I thought that I'd seen but forgotten that 1942 version so I decided to view it again for comparison purposes just after watching this new version.  (I soon realized I'd never seen it at all because what I vaguely remembered was a black-haired young Liz Taylor in it, not blonde!)  It became clear to me that the new 1994 version made an attempt to find modern actors who resembled several of the actresses in the movie of 1942 (the facial features of Marme and Beth especially, and to a certain extent Amy; also the appearance and manner of the German professor was very similar.).  Scenically, the two movies were similar, too.  Some details in the two movies were handled differently.  Both had some agreeable features and were emotionally moving.  One of the improved treatments in the newer version was in the portrayals of both Aunt March and Amy; the new treatment offered greater depth of character and relationship, thus was more satisfying.  (Senior aunts viewing the movie would feel a bit more gratified to identify with the newer version of Aunt March and her ability to bring blessings to the family despite being a difficult personality!)This newer version of Little Women (and the older two versions that I've seen) all are very excellent movies with good things to offer.  They're each different and can stand alone as separate creations of worth in their own right.  And it's fun to compare and contrast all the versions.  (Now, I'd like to refresh my experience of the Hepburn version in order to examine it in the light of the other two.)I find no better way to briefly express my perception of a certain amount of failure in this new version than just to use the phrase "poorly realized."  It seemed a  "jumble" of focuses upon all the daughters' developments as differing personalities and their fates; it somehow felt fragmented because it didn't handle the many characters well.  For instance, very unsuccessful glimpse of father March and nothing more.  But, by comparison with the 1942 movie, I felt a greater appreciation of the way that the 1994 version did go into more detail about Meg's and Amy's love stories as well as Jo's.  After having experienced them just previously in the 1994 version, I missed the details of their stories while watching the 1942 version.  There was added depth, warmth, and richness in this newer version because of the additional focus on Meg's and Amy's fates in love.	6
429	...I almost have to say I liked it more than the book, which is heresy for me. This is the only movie that makes me cry every time I see it. Granted, they took some liberties like making Marmie a feminist, but I can't oppose that, even if it isn't perfectly accurate. A marvelous movie.	1
430	Have always loved this story, whether I'm reading it or watching it and this is the only film version I like, absolutely adore this movie.	1
431	I like the family atmosphere of the story. I'm saving this as a good November story to celebrate Thanksgiving. I enjoyed the twist in the plot added to the old story.	6
432	I have every book and version of &#34;Little Women!&#34;  I remember reading the book at 10 felt like I was transported to a time long ago in New England! A must for your library of DVD's!	6
433	This was always a fun favorite that I could never locate in a store! Arrived super fast and glitch free :-)	6
434	unbelievably BORING. This seemed like a BAD made for TV movie.  I can't say how uninteresting and bad I thought this movie was.	3
435	I often times get a 'cravin' to watch this movie! I did the other day and was not displeased! This is a wonderful movie. I have read the book, which was as good. Winona Ryder's portrayl of Jo is awesome as is Christian Bale's of Laurie. I think that the only complaint I have about this movie is the portrayal of Mr Bryne's character. He is seen in the movie as a older man, who was really quite charming in the bookThis is a great story for anyone who loves movies about sisterly love and charm!	1
436	One of my very favorites! Heartwarming story, well acted and one I love to watch over and over. Great around the holidays...or really anytime!	6
437	Good product, in perfect condition. Happy to have a DVD now, as I no longer have a VHS to play my VHS copy!	6
438	I needed to update my library with a Dvd, still love watching this movie around Christmas with the family.  These actors are my favorote for this movie.	6
439	Little Women was my favorite book growing up and I have read it several times.  I have also own both the Kathern Hepburn and the June Allison versions.  I saw this movie in the theater and I just finished watching it again today, 1/3/08 and I still think it is the best film adaptation.Over all, I think that this version has the best actors, the highest production values, and was  beautifully portrayed. It was like they were really those people. True, there were some scenes that weren't in the book but over all it was a faithful adaptation.Some of the things I especially liked was that the scene were Amy falls in the pond was included.  This was a very dramatic event in the book, and was left out of the other 2 versions. I also enjoyed the inclusion of Pickwick  papers.  I thought all the actresses were close in appearance to the characters and often posed like the engravings of the book. Christian Bale was a very good Laurie. Kirsten Durst was amazing as Amy.There were 4 things I really didn't like and wondered why they were included in this version. One, Susan Sarandon's portrayal of Marmie.  Marmie was not a feminist.  I'm guessing Armstrong felt Alcott was somewhat of a feminist in her own right and that's how she justified Sarandon's acting.  Meg always wanted a silk dress and for some reason she objected to it in this version.  Prof Bhaer did take Jo to the theater,but they had regular seats not ones backstage. Jo drinking and talking to men.  This is a very small thing and they do this in all period movies but all the kissing that Jo and Prof Bhaer did while they were in New York- We know that didn't happen.I don't think that there were ever be a better version, because of the quailty of the actors.	6
440	Very well done.  Jo has much more depth than the silly older version with Katherine Hepburn. Enjoyed it.	6
441	I absolutely loved this movie. It was very sad but very heart warming. Great family movie and I highly recommend it to others.	6
442	I never get tired of this adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott book. Winona Ryder plays Jo to perfection. The performance WAS worthy of an Oscar. Kirsten Dunst surprised me, giving off more acting range than previously expected. Her spoiled Amy is one of the characters that make the movie what it is. And Claire Danes as Beth was perfectly cast. The scene where Beth dies is so perfect because you find yourself in there with Jo, hiding from the thunder and turning to see Beth's probably dead body. That sounds so insensitive, but how else could I put it? Even as Jo says she hates Amy for burning her manuscript, she saves Amy from the ice-cold water and we feel the love these sisters all share. In the beginning, Meg is serious and composed. In the end, she's serious and composed yet still full of love and sense. Jo is a mischievous writer in the beginning. By the end, she is mature and realizing that she has much to learn. Beth never loses an inch of her genuine kindness, and it's sad to see her die. Amy is a spoiled little girl, and by the time the credits roll she's been to Europe and she's married and happy. These transformations are so believable that this movie will never feel old, and you'll be sucked right in to watch it all unfold before your eyes. An excellent film that should have gotten several Oscars.	3
443	My mother loves Little Women and has only had it on VHS until now. I decided I better buy her a DVD copy since our old VCR is bound to break down soon. My mother and sister always have loved this movie and book together.	6
444	You can't go wrong with buying this movie. It's a classic and well done. It's the second one I've had.	6
445	"Rich" is the word I would best use to describe this movie. It's rich in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors; rich in characters with all good-hearted men and women of character; rich in love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in storytelling.Yes, it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's, and not the sort of thing I would normally enjoy, but this movie was so well-done that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modern-era of film-making (late '60s to today), it is always a pleasure to see a totally clean and nice movie.The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon play "wholesome" roles, something they don't always do, but they do it well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets decent screen time.If this film appears slow in the first 20-30 minutes, hang in there because it gets better and better as it goes along. This is just a beautiful film with fantastic visuals and memorable story that should bring a tear or two to your eyes by the end. Great storytelling usually wins out, and that's the case with this movie.	3
446	Truly one of those wonderful films that never gets old; `Little Women' is a delightful movie experience that will find a place in anyone's heart.  Winona Ryder delivers a brilliant Oscar nominated performance as Jo March, the most outspoken of the March sisters.  The movie focuses mainly on her and her growth over the years as her family suffers during the Civil War.  Jo longs to be an author and provide for her family, but her dreams meet opposition along the way.  The girls fight, fall in love, fall apart and come back together before the credits roll but nothing ever seems forced, rushed or cluttered.The cast on the other hand is `cluttered' with young talent, Kirsten Dunst proving that age means nothing when you have natural talent and Claire Danes wonderfully capturing the heart of this film (is it just me or is she probably the BEST onscreen crier in the business!), as well as a young Christian Bale who plays the funny love interest almost as well as he plays the quiet psychopath (this guy truly is talented).  Susan Sarandon also co-stars as the girl's mother Abigail (or Marmee).  As I said, a truly wonderful film that never tires out, a film I could watch again and again.	3
447	This is one of those movies where if it's on, I have to watch it. I love the feel of this movie and around the holidays, I just love how it makes me feel. I am a sucker for a period piece and this one is flawless. None of the acting or clothes seem out of place for the era. The majority of actors just can't pull it off and end up over acting. Everyone in this cast did an excellent job. I checked out the old version with Katherine Hepburn and I cringed all the way through it at her horrid idea of what &#34;quirky&#34; might have meant. She looked like a pure idiot and I was embarrassed FOR her.  Winona Ryder was as natural as they come and never once mistook quirky for imbecile. lol	6
448	This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's funny, exciting, sad, and neat. Now I am reading the book. My mom has it and since my sister Lisa was reading the book, my mom remembered it and we saw the movie. All  the characters played their parts very well and it makes the show great.  Buy it and you'll love it too.	2
449	When remaking a classic and staying within the time period that the novel was written in, the film makers should stay within the author's intentions as well. Now had they updated the movie and changed it to a more modern time period, then I would understand the undertones of feminism or activism so prevalent, but in my opinion, it's not completely appropriate in this version.Costuming was great, the &quot;look&quot; of the movie was dead-on and spectacular. It was the over-tones of feminisism I take issue with. Sure the March family is &quot;ahead of it's time&quot; and &quot;different.&quot; The movie expertly captures that on the screen. But some of the speeches didn't ring true to the original. Once again, had they updated the tale to a more modern time period I would have believed it more having read the novel and knowing the characters and their intentions.Casting was great. Some reviewers had a problem with the actresses who played the roles of both Amy and Beth. Well, I tend to agree. Kristen Dunst did a great job portraying Beth, but she was too tall for the part! That is OK for stage and you can get past such minor annoyances, but on the big screen it is hard to get around visual appearances. Dunst did a great acting job though, her Beth made me cry harder than all the rest of them. Very believable and heart renching. The dual-Amy bit was irritating. One actress would have been preferable over splitting it between two actresses. It changed the mood terribly but didn't ruin the movie.Jo March is one of the best characters in literature and she is brought to life beautifully by Winona Ryder. What  plum role, what an amazing actress.Over all, I loved the movie. It is a perfect holiday movie to watch with the family and enjoy again and again.	7
450	As many have already commented, I cannot fathom how people can say this film is "just like the book." I really enjoyed the movie, but there were several obvious ways it deviated from the book. For example, the story of Jo and Laurie is quite different! The movie suggests that his profession of love was a shocking thing for Jo, but in the book she long suspected that he was falling in love with her and left home (with Marmee's approval) in order to discourage his growing feelings. However, I still really loved this movie. It's so perfect for the holidays! Personally, I had a really hard time with Susan Sarandon being cast as Marmee - my image of this character is totally different from what I saw in the film. Despite that it's still a wonderful, enjoyable film.	6
451	I was a little anxious before the projection of Australian director Gillian Armstrong's LITTLE WOMEN. I vaguely remembered the 1949 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Amy and that was about all I could say about that classic of American literature. Two hours later, everybody was happy, my wife and my daughter had their share of emotions and Kleenex and I had at least understood why such a smart director as Gillian Armstrong who directed MY BRILLIANT CAREER and MRS. SOFFEL, two movies about strong women characters, got interested in directing LITTLE WOMEN.In my opinion, the director wished, by describing the lives of these four sisters, to portray four historical phases of the status of the women in the western society. Claire Danes as Beth is the model of these women who, for centuries, waited that their family chose a husband for them and, often, didn't marry because they were too poor or because they had to take care of their aging parents. Meg portrays the woman who has the chance to marry the man she's in love with, a man accepted by the family even if he doesn't give to Meg the possibility to rise socially : it's the classic marriage who's gained more and more popularity from the mid XIXth century. The third phase of this allegory is portrayed by Amy, a woman who knows from the start on that she will marry a wealthy man who'll support her and, at least, we have Jo who doesn't care to marry a poor man as long as this man won't stop her doing what she wants during her life. In this perspective, LITTLE WOMEN can provide some pleasure even to those of us who don't specially like this kind of classic family movie.A DVD zone use your head.	5
452	I enjoyed this show. The version is great. The actors and actress we great. I am so happy it ended the way it did, Will watch gain.	6
453	i am a fortunate person. i had a 2nd grade teacher that turned me on to many of the classics of american literature.  but it takes a lifetime to understand what many of these books are about.  particularly 'little women'.but if someone doesn't have a lifetime, then they can get a great adaptation of the material and view it as a film.  such is the case with the most recent version of 'little women'.the screenplay is a living thing, inspiring the musical which recently starred sutton foster on broadway.  and the wise decision to not have a grown actress play amy as a child is even more fortunate.  this role is split between kirsten dunst and samantha mathis and both are admirable.  as are mary wickes as GREAT-aunt march and susan sarandon as the most warm and maternal abigail march of the many versions.trini alvarado and winona ryder are both effective as meg and jo.  in past versions, meg has always been a ravishing beauty (frances dee or janet leigh in particular) but alvarado makes more of the role by investing qualities of composure in her performance.  ryder, while not as striking as katharine hepburn or brusque as june allyson, is still a capable and enchanting jo.but the real movie-making performance is claire danes' beth.  she and gilian armstrong keep beth ever present, even when the character is at her lowest ebb.  i can't stop my eyes from filling with tears when she joins her family for christmas. and her final moments are once again enriched by that wonderful adapation of the novel's words. danes, in fact, is the only one of the young actresses that attempts a new-england accent.my only criticism, on that note, is pronunciation of one word.  marmee.  the 'r' sound is like an 'h' if a person lives in new england.  even to this day.  it would be mah-mee.  mah-mee.  get it?	6
454	Greak remake of a clasic film. My sister loved it 60 years ago. Still good. Am passing it on to the young girls I know.	6
455	There is an old maxim in Hollywood that good books make bad movies.  It's only in filming lousy books that you have a chance to make a good picture.  Nowhere has the lie been put to that old saw better than with this picture,  the fourth (and best) film adaptation of Lousia May Alcott's beloved novel.  This is one good book that has made a great film, one of the most charming  and delightful I have seen in a long time.The story revolves around the  four March girls, all of them bright, beautiful and talented.  Jo (Winona  Ryder) is the narrator-and the author of the story-and the primary focus of  the plot.  She is an aspiring writer who is afraid to give voice to her  heart.  Rather than write about her innermost thoughts and feelings, she  squanders her talent writing lurid melodramas and purple tales of romance  and intrigue.  It is only when she gives in to her muse and puts her true  passion into her work that she finds fulfillment.Next in age is Beth  (Clare Danes), a quiet girl plagued by ill health.  When she sits at the  piano, you forget her frailty, captivated by the beautiful music she makes.  She is  a lonely girl, not as ambitious as her sisters.  The only thing  she wants from life is to stay home, protected by the loving embrace of her  family, especially her beloved mother Marney (Susan Sarandon).Youngest  is Amy (Kirsten Dunn as a child, Samantha Mathis later), a charming little  child who grows into a lovely young woman and a promising artist.  She is  the one who has the clearest picture of her future.  No matter what, she is  going to marry a man with money.The oldest girl, Meg (Trini Alvarado)  is the odd one out.  She is not as pretty, smart or gifted as the others.  She is, though, the most refined and proper sister, always concerned with  the girls' behavior.  She is also the one who finds happiness the  quickest.On no fewer than half a dozen occasions while watching  &quot;Little Women,&quot; I found myself on the brink of tears.  It is  certainly a story that evokes strong emotions.  They are emotions, though,  that are genuinely earned.  I was so moved because I cared so much about  the March girls.  When they felt love or joy or sorrow or pain, I felt it  along with them.  That is a tribute to the fine work done by director  Gilian Armstrong, screenwriter Robin Swicord and, especially, these five  wonderful young actresses.It is rare to see a film that deals so  honestly and thoughtfully with the love shared between siblings, especially  if they are women.  These are girls who share a bond that is more important  than marriage or wealth or anything else.  To watch them together, to see  the casual intimacy and obvious affection they share for each other is to  witness something really special.  It is a treat to be allowed, even for  such a short period of time, to be part of their family.  &quot;Little  Women&quot; is an exquisitely beautiful film, and one that I shall not soon  forget.	16
456	This movie is great to watch at Christmas time. I think it is not as detailed as the book, but definately as good. Though in the book, Louisa May Alcott focuses on all the girls, but in the movie they focus on Joe, it is a bit of a tear jerker, but still farely jolly. It's wonderful to curl up on the couch on a snowy or rainy day with a soft blanket and like one piece of kleenex. I recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.	2
457	A beautiful, believable story with a wonderfully accomplished cast (Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Gabriel Byrne) - Ms. Alcott would be proud!  I have nothing but the highest praise for this adaptation!!  Save yourself the rental costs and just buy it already!  You will be amazed at how often you find yourself watching it.	6
458	I felt that this version of little women, is the best ever made. All the girls fit there parts perfectly. You feel as though you know them. JO was absolutly fabulas. I thought the movie was great. Definatly worth your time and money. If you like classics or "old" movies.... you don't wanna miss this one. 4 stars maybe more!!!!	2
459	The dvd has subtitles at the bottom that you can't remove!  I was not happy about that and we can't remove them :(	6
460	Love the movie, I watch it every Christmas.  Somehow, when ordering this, I missed or it was omitted, that it was for European DVD players only.  Won't work on the players made for the American market.  I wish it would have been clearer when I ordered it.	3
461	While this film version of LITTLE WOMEN does not follow the book exactly, it captures its spirit with expert performances and cinematography. The soundtrack beautifully enhances this classic story of a family of women, struggling largely by themselves, in unforgiving New England.This may be Winona Ryder's best role - she captures the ambitious spunk of Jo with a winning performance.  As Jo's sisters, Trini Alvarado (Meg), Claire Danes (Beth) and Kirsten Dunst (the young Amy) give strong, if sometimes uneven, performances.  Susan Sarandon as Marmee has the right measure of no-nonsense Puritanism; her feminist lines often are too heavy-handed for this film that otherwise has a light touch, but the way she sweeps into a room overshadows any flaws in the writing.All in all, this is an excellent adaptation.  Children may be bored by the art film pace, but teens and adults will delight in these characters brought to life by nuanced performances.Highly recommended.	14
462	This 1994 retelling of the Louisa May Alcott classic glows with a warmth and radiance of a terrific cast. This production was lovingly dedicated to kidnap-murder victim Polly Klass, who had considered the novel to be her favorite, and on whose behalf, as it is well-known, Winona Ryder, a former resident of Klaas' neighborhood, helped in the search.The flaws of the film are that it occassionally goes out of sequence; those familiar with the book know that Beth does live to become an aunt, and it doesn't go into full detail on the subject of Amy's will, although that topic is beautifully covered in one short sequence.Susan Sarandon's Marmee has a staid, dignified charisma as a free-thinking woman dealing with many tribulations but who does a superb job of bringing up her four girls alone while their father is at war.Trini Alvarado is a surprising choice for the part of the older sister, Meg. But she is very much up to the challenge. We see her as a fine, strong, principaled young woman who craves the things girls traditionally crave, but who is tempered by the moral guidance of her mother.Winona Ryder is perfect as the tomboyish writer, Jo. Her spunk and cheerfulness are sheer delight as she portrays a young woman ahead of her time in so many ways. She is plucky and rescourceful in some pretty unconventional ways at times as she helps the family through its hardships.Clare Danes' Beth, the quiet, ill-fated sister, is warm and generous as a middle child who honors the strenghth and nobility of her mother and sisters during her short time on Earth.Effervescent little Kirsten Dunst, gives spark to young Amy March, and Samantha Mathis who has the acting genes of her talented grandmother, Gusti Huber, lends a graceful maturity and radiant beauty to the older Amy.In one of her final roles, Mary Wilkes, ia a rather crotchety Aunt March, who seems to enjoy the company of her young nieces, but who refuses to overindulge them with her wealth despite their poverty. Florence Patterson is the March's wise and emotional housekeeper, Hannah. Christian Bale's Laurie is impish and understated, John Neville is his reserved, but ultimately generous grandfather. Eric Stolz provides a pleasant presence as John Brook. Matthew Walker isn't given much to do as Mr. March, but somehow, it doesn't seem to matter. Gabriel Byrne is much more handsome than Alcott's description of Professor Bhaer, and his portrayal, like that of the principal characters, is one of effortless warmth.The sets and colors seem authentic, and the film's appeal is that the cast really brings them alive. We can easily share the laughter and tears of this family and we don't feel that they are some archaic prudes from a very different time. The fact that I can see a bit of myself in each of the sisters makes this story as relevant today as it was a century ago.	3
463	It was a heart warming  movie based in a time period of such cultural reconstruction. A touching family film worth sharing.	6
464	This is a fantastic story about a close family of females with a strong mother and supportive father.  The daughters are blessed with comfort while also knowing pain and show a side of compassion that is steered by a strong and compassionate mother played by Susan Sarandon.  Observing how Jo, the main character evolves into a great writer should inspire all of us to persevere in our passions.  She embraces life and yet in doing so shows us the deepest side of humanity.	6
465	I've loved this movie since I was a kid. Great performances by some great Actors. If you're up for seeing a young love-tortured Christian Bale, you will not be disappointed!!	6
466	i ordered this to watch with my granddaughter. i really like this movie. it was just what we expected. I would order again. thank you	1
467	I borrowed this DVD from my friend, and after one week ordered my own copy.  It is the best version of Little Women that I have ever seen.  Even my 3 year old daughter loved it and would dance around the room in her dress-up clothes to be like Jo.  Wynona Ryder is wonderful in this heartwarming family movie.  I highly recommend it.	4
468	I SELL MADAME ALEXANDER DOLLS LITTLE WOMEN GROUPS AND I ALWAYS SELL THE BOOK WITH THE 6 LITTLE DOLLS USUALLY FOR CHRISTMAS.	1
469	I thought this was very well made. Good production values, no skimping on sets. Pretty well sticks to the book, which is included along with the DVD, so if you have never read it, you have that opportunity, as well. As is often the case, the book includes a little material not seen in the film, but the only way that can be remedied, generally, is by making a longer film, something which is often not practical because of theater screen time, and even DVD capacity. If you have already read the book, I suspect you will like this. Certainly, if you like as many as two of the actresses seen here, you will like it.	6
470	I remember when this film hit the theaters and I thought, "Oh, no!  Not another version!  Not another film about young women seeking their place int the world and the men they want to share it with!"  I could not have been more mistaken.  This movie is nearly perfect!  The acting on all fronts is in the least, professional, at the most, Oscar worthy!  Notice all the exclamations!!!  This movie is loaded with fine detail.  From the costumes to the props to the sets(to the haircuts!), this is an expertly crafted film version of the much celebrated novel. The only question I have is about the casting of Gabriel Byrne as "Jo's" ultimate love interest.  Mr. Byrne acquits himself well and is memorable, but it is just hard for me to see Winona Ryder matched up with him.  Throughout the rest of the film the casting is perfect, the chemistry is superb.  Buy this film now!  Remember, I'm a guy raving about this movie!	4
471	This version of Little Women is a classic in its own right.  Armstrong did an amazing job here capturing the period and coaxing beautiful performances from her cast. Ryder, Dunst, Alvarado, Mathis, Sarandon, Byrne, Bale and a heartbreaking Danes are all in top form.  Visually, the movie is just beautiful and the soundtrack is mesmerizing. A must see.	47
472	The acting is superb, the storyline is impeccable.  This is another film for the avid movie collector.  Any mother of girls must have this movie!	6
473	When I watched this remake of Little Women for the first time I remember that I was a bit disappointed. Artistic license was taken throughout the movie downplaying religion, inserting feminism, and changing characters in various ways, so that one might very well ask, "Is this really Little Women?" But the movie remains in my library and I can't tell you how many times I've watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I cry every time. Each time I wonder do I have another tear left for this movie? And sure enough, before I know it I'm a basket case--what a catharsis! One downside--soft voices and subtitles--I prefer voices I can hear and no subtitles!The cinematography is breathtaking, the music haunting and lovely, and the characters grow on you. So what if they made Marmee into a feminist or that Winona Ryder, as Jo, is far too pretty so that one must almost laugh when she laments that she's ugly and awkward. So what if Claire Danes as Beth is a healthy-looking girl or that Kirsten Dunst as young Amy is childish? Somehow you grow to love these characters. And you'll cry when Beth dies whether you feel that she looks frail enough for the part or not. And, oh, don't tell me that Gabriel Byrne as Mr. Bhaer doesn't make a wonderful suitor! He knocks this 66-year-old lady's socks off! He's handsome and yet European enough to make you believe, whether he has the German accent right or not, that he's a professor, a bit different, someone whom our free-thinking Jo can love.So although artistic license is taken, this movie still resembles the book and adults and children of all ages can enjoy it. I have one criticism of a small detail which seems important to the story. It's not made at all clear as to why Jo is trying to hide out at the dance--no mention is made of the fact that the back of her dress is scorched from standing too close to the fireplace. And when Laurie looks at the back of her dress, one wonders why unless one, of course, has read the book. I loved the book as a child and read it many times, but I'm well aware that some of our young people may not have read the book. They have added things to the movie that aren't in the book and taken things out. But, still, the bottom line is that the moral values are excellent, the story is heartwarming, the characters are endearing, and it will tug at your heartstrings.I tried to do a review of the 1949 Little Women and the powers that be stated that I'd already done a review, so I don't think it's possible to do separate reviews for the various versions of Little Women. So I'll just state here that all the versions have something good to offer. I can't say much about the TV movie with Meredith Baxter Birney and Susan Dey because I saw it just once many years ago. I remember that it was hard for me to really get into that movie, though, because the actors were so familiar to me. I am one of those rare individuals who hasn't seen Winona Ryder in other productions and I will even admit that I'm not much of an old movie buff or even a movie buff at all so I haven't seen a lot of Katherine Hepburn. Katherine Hepburn is the perfect Jo, I feel; she is a wonderful Jo. In fact, she is my favorite part of the 1933 version, with the women who play Beth and Amy tying for second place. The 1933 version overdoes the playacting. The singing is atrocious and it's just not the type of thing you want to watch over and over. You tend to want to fast forward. I think the 1949 version is almost perfect and would perhaps be even more so if Katherine Hepburn were Jo. June Allyson is wonderful. But Hepburn is quintessential Jo even though she is almost too beautiful for the part. But she can make the funniest faces which compensate for her overall beauty. She can actually make herself look very homely just by mugging for the camera. The 1949 and 1933 versions stick more closely to the book which, let's face it, makes more sense especially when you have read the book. I loved the book, and I think that if I would have seen the 1994 version as a child I would have been rather disappointed--I would have wondered what happened to Little Women. But I will admit that as an adult I really enjoy the cinematography and the music of the 1994 version. It never grows old. It's just a feast for the eyes and ears. Little Women is a beautiful story for children and adults and I just can't say enough about how wonderful it is that it has been brought to the screen so many times--each time in a slightly different way.	6
474	This movie captivates from start to end.  I find it flawless, extremely well-acted.  I will continue to watch it from time to time.	6
475	I'm skeptic when it comes to remakes of classic movies - this by far is now my favorite holiday movie.	6
476	I remember first hearing Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN read by Jacqueline Bissett on record, and immediately fell in love with it.  Afterwards, I immediately polished off the novel, and saw the subsequent film adaptations.  This 1994 production, directed by Gillian Armstrong (MY BRILLIANT CAREER), is a beautifully acted, lusciously filmed and engaging film triumph.  We watch the trials and triumphs of the March family, through the eyes of the four March sisters.  Meg (Trini Alvarado), Jo (Winonah Ryder), Beth (Claire Danes) and Amy (Kirsten Dunst) live with their mother in a little town in Pennsylvania and are awaiting the return of their father's return from war, where is he is serving as a chaplain in the Union Army.  All four girls have very distinctive personalities that vary greatly from one another, and their mother (Susan Sarandon) is nothing short of their rock, in the face of many, many hardships the family must face together.For all of you Louisa May Alcott fans, I would say that this film stayed very true to the novel and the actresses truly embody the beautiful characters from the story.  Winonah Ryder earned a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal of Jo March, the headstrong tomboy with a hot temper and a passion for writing.  This character was actually based on Louisa May Alcott, during her formative years.  What's more, the plot is based largely on vignettes from Alcott's life as a young girl, growing up in Germantown, Pennsylvania.  I reccomend that you watch this film and read the book, not necessarily in that order.  This beautiful piece will make you laugh, cry and is perfect for the whole family.	3
477	Viewers expecting a faithful adaptation of Louisa M. Alcott's novel are likely to be disappointed.  However Gillian Armstrong's film is a charming piece - beautifully photographed with a strong sense of seasonal change and how the March family react to such changes.  The lighting - both natural and artificial - is soft yet atmospheric, the use of music unobtrusive yet significant.  Yet Armstrong does not want to produce a heritage film, prompting viewers to admire the historically accurate sets and costumes; on the contrary, her approach remains strongly character-focused, with the attention paid to nuances of performances.  Winona Ryder gives perhaps the best performance of her entire career as Jo; her command of gesture and facial expression is impeccable, especially at those moments of extreme disappointment (for example, when she is told that her first book manuscript is actually no good).  A young Kirsten Dunst is both childlike yet mature as Amy; someone who wants to act grown-up yet yearns for her father to be around.  Susan Sarandon turns in a winning performance as the matriarch of the family; someone who is incredibly fond of her offspring, yet well aware of their individual faults.  The ending might be sentimental, but Armstrong is nonetheless well aware of the economic hardships experienced by the March family as they struggle to survive while their father is away fighting.  Definitely one of the best classic adaptations to appear during the Nineties.	6
478	This is by far my favorite movie. There's something about this storyline and production of the film that bring you back in time and wish you were Jo.	1
479	I bought this movie for my wife when it was available on VHS and she liked it so much, I figured it was time to buy it on DVD.  I have not seen every edition of this movie but I saw one from many years before this edition and it was terrible; it didn't exactly follow the script.  This version does.  This movie is a great movie that never grows old.	6
480	I just bought a DVD player recently and this is the third of my DVD purchases (tells you how much this film means to me :) I saw the film in 1995 and I liked it, but not until I was 17 did I see it again and truly capture the meaning in the film and understand it. I watched it about 3 times when I rented it, and couldn't help but cry a few times during it as it was so wonderful. I hadn't cried that much since I had seen &quot;Imitation of Life,&quot; with Lana Turner. Overall, the DVD is pretty good, has some good narrations about the costumes, some behind the scenes featuring Winona Ryder, Kristen Dunst, and Susan Surandon. I enjoyed the trivia games, even. And like always with a DVD, the color and clarity was beyond expectations :) This is not only a feast for the eyes, but for the ears, too. :)	6
481	LITTLE WOMEN struck me as a badly directed and stupidly bent Alcott adaptation--that is always the director's fault. The galaxy of stars here, from (then-popular) Wynona Ryder to Susan Sarandon, is puzzling because they did not need more than a few big stars.The main trouble is this thing is nothing but a show-off's nightmare. The direction is bad so I cannot blame any of the players, but this struck me as a look into a severely nerdy family as directed by a ... dare I say it ... severely nerdy director. NOT GOOD!In the end, this made us want to watch a wonderful English film likePersuasionor something. We enjoyed it as it unfolded erratically, but it simply doesn't cut the mustard. My wife warned me about it when it was new, but I just gave it a try.You may do the same, or give it a miss. The Little Misses won't mind and you will not be missing anything, I promise you. All this film did for me was to decry the present state of Claire Danes and Wynona Ryder.	1
482	Previous film versions of Little Women carefully avoided all mention of Alcott's political interests as an abolitionist and a feminist.  This version, however, shoves them right in your face and never lets you forget them.  When Marmee (Susan Sarandon) delivers her first feminist lecture it comes off sounding more like a commercial than anything you're likely to hear during the course of a normal conversation.  In fact, all of Sarandon's speeches sound like formal addresses one might hear in some lecture hall as opposed to one's home where all of Marmee's views would certainly have been known by rote.  Nothing about these rants is subtle.  Unfortunately, long after they've made their point, they're still relentlessly hammering home their single-minded message, just in case a viewer might have missed or forgotten them.  I found this approach jarring and unwelcomed.  As for the rest of the story, they touch on the same events as all the other adaptations but in a roundabout fashion, adding things, misplacing other key elements.  I have to say, after watching this movie, if I ever had a desire to read the book, I certainly don't have that desire now.  There is very little about this movie that I liked or enjoyed watching.  To make matters worse, they wasted the considerable talent of Mary Wickes in the thankless role of Aunt March, literally giving her nothing to do.  John Neville fared even worse as the overlooked neighbor Mr. Laurence.	2
483	This is a wonderful movie a must have for getting closer to your family in a way one can't explain . This movie will help you see who you realy are . Leaning On God is the one and only way to see the Truth about how our live's are to go . This movie will bless you in many wonderful way's . God Bless	5
484	This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.	6
485	I love this movie.it so touching. Is one of my favorite movie and you can't go wrong with it :)	6
486	...but I barely recognised the story. Many of the traits that gave Louisa May Alcott's characters their charm were either played down or eliminated entirely.Several other reviewers have amply treated the artificial, excessive feminism, and I agree with their viewpoints - in fact, it would have been annoying even in a film set in the year 2001. As well, it seemed that the vaguely bitter, obligatory feminism ruined the depiction of the girls themselves.One of Louisa's most clever, concise parts of her book was the opening, wherein the conversations between the four sisters give the reader an excellent introduction to each of their characters. This scene, for reasons unknown, was eliminated - and, as later action would show, the girls, from tomboy Jo to forgivably vain Meg, are not to be permitted any traits that detract from a perfectly politically correct image.For example, as a child reading the Alcott book, I most identified with Meg without having her prettiness - enjoying fine things, rather vain, envious of wealthier friends. When we first &quot;meet&quot; her in the book, she is pining for a silk dress (which her mother will not allow her until she is 18), and, in the later &quot;party&quot; sequence, Meg greatly enjoys being prettied until she overhears an elder acquaintance saying she'd been made a fool of. The film's Meg is an odd combination of Puritan and political activist - wanting to be pretty or well-dressed must be pass&eacute;, she feels dreadful guilt about the (innocent) party, and she cannot wear silk because of the treatment of workers in China!Though I myself am far from puritanical, and found some of the book's depictions of sacrifice to be puzzling (for example, how does denying one's self a small Christmas gift do anything for the soldiers?), one of the book's strongest themes is religious - witness the constant references to Pilgrim's Progress. One wonders, with this film, just why the sisters are so apparently deprived.The photography is excellent, and sometimes stunning, and I imagine that those unfamiliar with the book will want this video on their shelves because it is &quot;for the whole family.&quot; But don't obtain this one for anyone who has ever loved the original Little Women.	88
487	This movie was funny, sad, and touching. It was about these four sisters who have to cope with there dad being at war. A definite 5 star!  P.S. The book is really good, too!	2
488	I have read the book Little Women as a little girl of about seven and I fell in love with it.  Imagine how I feel about a well written and wonderfully acted movie Bravo and Brava to everyone!!!!	6
489	This film was a truly remarkable adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women.  The cast is near perfect, although I couldn't picture Claire Danes as &quot;Beth&quot;, she was wonderful emotionally mind you but she wasn't physically &quot;Beth&quot;.  Winona Ryder puts on a stunning performance as &quot;Jo&quot;, I could go to sleep to the sound of her voice.  And Kirsten Dunst is the unforgettable &quot;Amy&quot;, she's so cute.  Later in the film Samantha Mathis plays grown up &quot;Amy&quot; and though not as cute as Kirsten Dunst she's very pretty and portrays the grown &quot;Amy&quot; very well.  Trinni Alvarodo is the mortherly &quot;Meg&quot; and is exactly how I picture Meg to be.  Susan Saradan is loveable &quot;Marmee&quot; and is so moving in that role that you almost wish she was your own mother.  The movie followed the novel very nicely and though a few scenes from the book were not included in the movie(those missing scenes aren't an any versions of Little Women), it was still a heart-warming film and one that I love watching again and again.	3
490	Good product and rec'd. within the promised time.  I love the movie and am replacing my VHS version with this one.	6
491	This is overall an enjoyable and fairly faithful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's well-loved book, but it, like the other filmed versions, has its problems.I wish, for instance, that they hadn't chosen to combine Alcott's first two books about the March family into one film.  This results in many small but enjoyable scenes being cut or compressed, and some characters (Laurie's grandfather, for instance) all but ignored.  Moreover, the second book, Good Wives, is more uneven and less enjoyable than Little Women--too sprawling and pat--which drags the second half of the film down.Generally the performances are quite good.  I like Winona Ryder's fiestiness and humour as Jo, although I feel that she was physically a little too pretty and delicate.  Claire Danes was a disappointment, although she's usually very reliable.  Her Beth was properly shy, but not soft and capable as she should be. Her retincence seemed almost like a mental handicap.  Trini Alvarado was great as Meg, she really seemed like a product of that era, and Kirsten Dunst had Amy pretty much down pat.  Samantha Mathis, playing the older Amy was all wrong though, too old to be only four years older (she looked older than Ryder) and far, far too stilted.  Gabriel Byrne's professor was the perfect antidote to Christian Bale's Laurie, too.  It was easy to see why Jo would choose The Professor...but then I'd take Gabriel Byrne over just about anyone.	4
492	This is one of my favorite movies! I can watch it everyday and never get tired of it! Especially during the holidays! Great product and super fast shipping thanks!!!!	6
493	The most recent screen version of Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is definitely worth your time and money. And it simply isn't enough to rent it occasionally; you need it in your personal collection.The script is faithful to the book: although a few scenes aren't here and some details are a bit different, it doesn't take away from the charm, or the unique satisfaction that comes only from watching a great film. It's clear that everyone involved with creating the picture, both in front of and behind the cameras, gave their best efforts with very fine results.The plot: The March family live in Massachusetts during the Civil War. Mr. March is away doing his part for the Union, leaving his wife (Susan Sarandon) to mind the roost and the four March sisters: sensible Meg (Trini Alvarado); plucky, tomboyish and brainy Jo (Winona Ryder); sweet, tenderhearted Beth (Claire Danes); and hilariously vain little Amy (Kirsten Dunst and later in the film, Samantha Mathis). The girls go through poignant changes together as well as individually and have some highly amusing spats. There's also some deep heartache (I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie yet). Regardless of their troubles and circumstances, the March clan stays tightly knit.Mrs. March takes a light feminist turn in this version of the film, and although it's something I could do without, it doesn't change the tone any. The casting is superb; the actresses playing the sisters compliment each other very well. And the hunk factor is astounding! Eric Stoltz and Christian Bale are just dandy as John Brooke and Theodore &quot;Laurie&quot; Lawrence, but it's Gabriel Byrne who really butters my toast! His Professor Bhaer is one of the best roles I've seen him in, and his scenes with Ms. Ryder are memorable and very sweet.This movie has the feel and taste of a film from the Golden Age; it's refreshing to see a modern film that's truly entertaining with no sex, violence or bad language, and no flashy special effects to detract from the acting. It's a great movie for all ages without being fluffy or cheesy. You can feel the warmth and charm jumping out of the screen, making it impossible not to love all of the characters you meet, even fussy old Aunt March!The bottom line: A beautiful little film to watch year-round, alone or with friends and family. Don't miss this one.	7
494	Louisa May Alcott's book has come to life in vivid detail and beauty. The casting is superb. The four sisters are a pleasure to watch and view as they develop into young ladies who experience both the pleasures and pains of growing into adulthood. The film depicts the changes in each character from adolescence and the growing pains associated with making independent decisions based on their personalities and values. As young ladies with education who grew up in a household where their opinions were heard and mattered, they stand in direct contrast with the majority of girls growing up at that time ...In the attic, the sisters enact all the parts of a play which Jo had written ... it was a great moment when they invited Theodore Lawrence into their circle of friends. The individuality of each sister is quite evident. The film does a fine job of presenting each character, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy as unique individuals who blossom, each into her own personality, when they are forced to make choices and deal with building their own lives. The film shows the flow of everyday life around the time of the Civil War, when their father was serving as a soldier. The film does a wonderful job of showing the social structure and class differences of the era. The language, speech and manners of the times are well acted ...The close bonds of sisterhood are threatened by Beth's illness, and eventual death. The film presents Jo, Meg and Amy as they develop into responsible adults with independent lives and interests apart from the cocoon of the family. Meg's courtship and eventual marriage to a school teacher/tutor is done well, especially the birth of their twins. Amy's ambitions of marrying into wealth and becoming a lady, and the value conflicts associated with this desire when she meets Theodore Lawrence in Paris is superbly done. Jo's move to live in New York at a boarding house, broadens her life experiences as she is challenged by Frederick, a German professor she bumps into by chance. Her wings are spread as she learns to fly solo within this new and challenging environment. Despite their differences, the sisters are forever connected by the bonds of family and love which makes the book and film an enduring classic. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]	20
495	I hadn't seen Little Women in a long time, so I forgot what a great story it is! I loved following the lives of the March family, and really appreciated the outright feminist views!	6
496	Little Women is a timeless classic. Written by Louisa May Alcott, this novel was first published in 1868. This novel is about a New England family composed of a mother... "Marme" played by Susan Sarandon, and four daughters growing up during the American Civil War.The author wrote about her own experiences as a child in Concord, Massachusetts, where she lived with her three sisters, Anna, May, and Elizabeth.Their father is away fighting. Times are tough, money is scarce, and needs are many. But these women valiantly work hard at continuing their studies while trying to survive.Louisa May Alcott wrote about young women overcoming character flaws. The March girls are: Meg, who is vain, Jo who is hot tempered and stubborn, Beth who is introverted and shy, and the youngest, Any who is selfish and vindictive.Jo, played by Winona Ryder, is an outspoken, vivacious, playful dreamer, who wants to become a writer. A very young Kirsten Dunst plays the part of the younger daughter, so selfish and vindictive that because she does not have a ticket to go to the theatre with her sisters, she destroys a story her sister Jo was writing.The movie is set in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the scenic beauty of this film is magnificent. During the course of the story, these girls become friends with the next door neighbor, who soon joins them in their intricate games and character reproduction of the writings of Jo.The twists and turns of the lives of these women are simply a rare joy to watch.	4
497	I've seen every movie version of the classic Louisa May Alcott novel, Little Women, written in the 19th century--when this was a contemporary novel. I've enjoyed them all, but this one is my favorite.The casting choices are extremely well done. Susan Sarandon makes a wonderful Marmee, and Wynona Ryder does an excellent job as Jo. A young, handsome and charismatic Christian Bale makes it as difficult as ever to be reconciled to Jo not choosing Laurie as her husband. However, the casting of Gabriel Byrne as Professor Bhaer makes her choice a bit more bearable. I've always had a fondness for Gabriel, a very handsome and personable actor in his own right.All in all, this is definitely the version to watch if choosing only one.	6
498	This movie is one classic movie. It is good to watch it with family, friends.. ;)	1
499	Despite what other reviewers have said about it's "artificiality", and faulty feminism; I really enjoyed this movie, and think it is probably the most faithful adaptation of the novel. The characters were actually more realistic and played with much more depth than I've seen in other versions. If you are a fan of the book at all or like nice, clean, yet enjoyable family films; watch this. Grab your favorite dessert, cuddle up on the couch and prepare to both laugh and cry. Wonderful!	1
500	Little Women is my favorite movie of all time.  It tells a story of 4 sisters.  While watching this film you are taken through their fun times, their dreams, their trials and heart aches.  This Film was so well cast.  Wynona Ryder did an incredible job playing Joe.  She is such a beleivable character and everyone can relate to her.  I think the most important essence that this film portrays is the emotion.  Joe longs for her career as a writer.  You follow her path of trying to write the right peice.  Through the relationships with her sisters she finds her greatest tale was beside her all along. A warm heartfelt movie, that leaves you sobbing.	3
501	Not just for little women. Truly touches on the beauty and joy and sorrow of life and love and family.	6
502	Best version of Little Women I've seen! It really brought alive the characters from the book; just as I always thought they should be!It will definitely remain a favorite and one I must share with my family!	6
503	I must confess: I never read the book; I never saw the theatrical release; I never even watched this movie when it was first shown on TV. Somehow, by the rarest of conincidences, I caught it again in its unedited entirety on television last Christmas. Late at night, watching this movie alone after everyone's gone to sleep, with the spirit of the holidays still fresh in my body, I was entranced. I couldn't turn myself away. This was no movie; it was a revelation to me.This must sound silly to most people, for someone to relate a movie watching experience akin to religious awakening. To understand my initial response to this film would take scholars in psychology and sociology. Suffice it to say that I being an only-child has no siblings, and watching this movie makes me feel like I'm part of a real family every time, only if it's just for a couple of hours.Being a long-time resident of the area (Vancouver) where this movie was made couples me even closer to it emotionally. Every time that Thomas Newman score starts, every time the camera pans across the spring flowers, fall leaves and winter snow, every time any one of the &quot;sisters&quot; flashes a smile on screen, I feel like time and space stopped just a little, for me.I have since that initial viewing purchased the DVD. I watch it whenever my life gets too noisy. Go out and buy it if you haven't already. After that, whine to your mom for a sister or brother. I sure wish I did. :)	2
504	"Little Women" has been a personal favourite of mine for many years now. It is a beautiful reflection on the simple, yet equally important things in life, like love, family and ambition. Featuring wonderful performances from a star-studded cast, beautiful cinematography and tranquil music, "Little Women" has remained one of my favourite films of all time.Based on the novel by Louisa May Aclott, "Little Women" follows the lives of the four March sisters: Amy (Kirsten Dunst and Samantha Mavis), Beth (Claire Danes), Meg (Trini Alvarado) and the main character Jo (Winona Ryder). Following the absence of their father, who is serving in the war, the March sisters stick together, their bond strong. The story takes us on the individual journeys of each sister, especially Jo, an apsiring writing who wants nothing more to make it in the world dominated by men. Through boy-trouble, peer pressure, and a personal tragedy that rocks the family, Jo and her sisters try their best to stick together as a family. "Little Women" shows us the bittersweet transition from childhood to adulthood.The performances in the film are inspired. Susan Surrandon stars as the girls' kind and loving mother, and as usual portrays her character beautifully. Winona Ryder gained an Oscar nomination for this film, but the true star of the film, in my opinion is Claire Danes. Her role in the film, although being the least explored of the four girls, is so powerful and evokative, coming from just a 14-year-old Danes. A somewhat younger Kirsten Dunst is flawless as the young Amy March, though I must say that I disaproved of the casting of the older Amy, Samantha Mavis. Her performance was unbelievable, let alone the fact that she did not look anything like her younger self. Despite this the acting was very well done.The scenery is absolutely stunning! I simply love the images of the heavy snow, the golden Fall, the cosiness of the candle-lit living room. The scenery really draws you into this 18th century world, and gives you a wonderful fuzzy feeling inside.The music, personally is one of my favourite movie scores ever. Composer Thomas Newman blends tranquil string meleodies, with elements of oboe and a particularly heart-wrenching piano-solo (to name a few highlights), to really bring out the pureness of this movie and its morals. The music adds character and feeling to every scene, as every score does, and its simply gorgeous!My only reservations for this film would be that its final forty-minutes or so does not evoke that "magicalness" of the rest of the film. However, there are nevertheless some shining scenes, one of which I cry in every single time I watch it! (I shall not say what it is, or I will spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it!)So in conclusion, the acting, cinematography and music combined make this film one of my favourites. Despite some mismatches in role-casting and editiing, I believe this is a near-flawless film, and certainly one of the best adaptations of a classic novel there's ever been.	4
505	I've only seen two of the movie versions of Little Women, this one and the 1949 version, and I must admit I prefer this one. Not to put down the 1949 film, which is super charming and lovely and has the superior Jo (June Allyson, love her), but I think the 1994 version is a more coherent movie. The 49 version was clearly meant to stick closer to many of the book's storylines, but in doing so, I think it gave up a lot of character development between the sisters. This version makes me cry, always, oh God, how it makes me cry (it's pathetic, really...haha) and has terrific music and also Gabriel Byrne! Gabriel Byrne, you guys, come on. (In other news, is it so hard to find a German actor to play Mr. Bhaer?) ANYWAY. This movie certainly isn't without its faults (i.e. weird casting choice on grown-up Amy) but it's my personal favorite.	6
506	This movie is great! I love Christian Bale, Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, and, yes, Kirsten Dunst. However, this movie is not completely true to the book, as no movies truly are. They completely left out the beautiful conversation between Marmee and Jo about their tempers, Amy had the turquoise ring before ever going to Aunt March, Amy wasn't transformed as in the novel but she continued to seem to be a selfish girl, the transformation in Meg wasn't shown, and there wasn't enough of Beth! BUT, I love this movie for the acting, the warm homey feelings, and the fabulous clothes/hair/home made meals. haha	1
507	appreciated that the item was sent out ASAP and received in excellent condition...would use this vendor again...	6
508	This movie is a trip into the past when life was not so busy and stressful, as it so easily can become today.  Life was simple and children had time to dream and use their imaginations.  Family took first priority above everything for most people and strong bonds were formed out of love and necessity.  All this was presented in this movie through good script writing and good acting.  We appreciate good, clean movies with uplifting and encouraging messages.  This movie ranks high among our favourites.	6
509	This is the kind of movies we love.  We enjoyed it so much thatwe ordered two more of the movies from this set.  Haven'treceived them yet but we are excited about them.	4
510	this movie is for all sister,it is a love story for sisters,i enjoyed and ceased every moments.thank you amazon !for excellance in every way possible,	6
511	My grand daughter is age 10 and she  loves to read. I had an easy version of the original book that she read, then wesaw the latest movie  and now she just wanted to read the original book.  She is loving it.	6
512	The book Little Women is a classic and so is this movie! Little Women captures everything Louisa May Alcott intended in her well loved novel.This movie is about 4 sisters growing up during the Civil War. A temporary poverty had settled upon their home and the girls and their mother, Marmee ( Susan Sarandon ) are doing their best to cope. Winona Ryder plays Jo, the 2nd oldest, Trini Alvardo plays the oldest, Meg. Claire Danes portrays Beth the 3rd oldest, while Kirsten Dunst captures the youngest, Amy.The film follows the girls over a course of roughly six years. It portrays their triumphs and tragedies, losses and gains, with heartfelt laughter in between. Some of the scrapes the girls get into is Jo attempting to teach Amy school, Meg making a fool of herself at a party, and whilest Beth tries to help her sisters get along. And of course everything changes when the girls meet Laurie, the rich boy next door.This movie is perfect for mothers and their daughters to watch together. It emphasizes family values, good morals, and also teaches life lessons along the way. This movie is worth your time! Join the March girls on an unforgettable adventure that you will never forget!	6
513	I mistakenly rated this a 5 star before realizing this is the version I returned,did not want, and ordered the one with the cast of the original I saw, starring Margaret O'Brien, June Allyson, Liz Taylor, etc., which in my memory rated a 5.  I am waiting for time to view it when I will not be interrupted by caregiving for an ill family member.  Thank you.	4
514	I first read the book a few years ago (I've always loved what guys call "Chick Lit"; yes, I'm very sentimental; most guys aren't; they're basically unemotional pigs who think only about sex) and loved it. I love period films anyway. BOOK & MOVIE SPOILER AHEAD!!! I cried when one of the major characters dies. She reminds me very much of my best friend who has always been there for me. The cinematography was absolutely stunning. Winona Ryder (who was excellent in dual roles in Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece "Bram Stoker' Dracula") is equally superb here, with Kirsten Dunst (fresh off her biting debut in "Interview With The Vampire"), Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Eric Stoltz, Christian Bale ("Empire Of The Sun," "Henry V"), Gabriel Byrne & Mary Wickes ("Now, Voyager") rounding out the cast. It's a faithful version of the story with absolutely nothing objectionable for family viewing. It received the PG rating for thematic elements (situations involving death). This is the kind of film that Hollywood rarely makes anymore (the seriously underrated classic "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" would be released the following year along with two excellent adaptations of Jane Austen's books: "Sense And Sensibility" &"Emma.") I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL those movies.	6
515	I LIKED IT SO MUCH I CAN NOT SAY ANY THING  BUT WONDERFUL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SO FUN TO READ YOU CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN!! ON 2ND THOUGHT THERE WAS ONE DISAPOINTMENT IT CAME TO AN END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	6
516	The film was a tad insipid....in any family there are conflicts.  Also, the father (I realize he wa away much of the time) was like a footnote in the family. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Marmee and the Captain.	6
517	i have watched this movie several times but never get tried of it.i love everything about i think every house hold should owen at least one copie.thanks	6
518	This is how movies should be done. Talented cast, and a well written script. It has heart and soul, it warms your heart.	1
519	This movie is fairly good. I like Christian Bale as Laurie, he played the part of the charming, handsome next door neighbor very well. I liked Kirsten Dunst as the young Amy and for the most part I liked Susan Sarandon as Marmee. What I didn't like was the modernising of the tale. Marmee's feminist rant against corsets was ridiculous and Meg refusing to wear silk was strange since in the book she wants a silk gown. Also Gabriel Byrne is much too handsome to play the part of Prof. Bhaer. And no offense to him, but his German accent was atrocious. And I didn't like Marmee giving Jo the idea of turning Plumfield into a school. Jo came up with that on her own. Still, overall a decent if not faithful movie.	6
520	I've had this movie for quite sometime, and watching it never gets old! Each time I laugh when Jo tells Laurie in the beginning at the ball, "Meg's completely bald in front." You will not be disappointed with the quality of this rendition of L.M.A.'s beloved story.	6
521	I LOVE this movie. I can watch it over and over again.  The characters are just great. The story is strong. It covers family bond and strength, friendship and love.	6
522	I have seen all of versions of Little Women.  However, with the music and the scene where Beth dies and Joe is remembering is the most touching scene in movie history.  The acting is up to date and not mushy like the others.  Most of all Beth dying made me cry up to about the seveth time.  I guess I`m all cried out.A great versiion.	6
523	I bought this DVD as a gift for my wife.  She loves this movie.I ordered the movie via amazon.com and it came from a different seller, but everything went smoothly.  I had no issues and not concerns when the movie arrived.  I was going out of town for the holidays and the movie arrived in plenty of time for me to take with me.	6
524	This is an excellent movie.  Excellent family entertainment !  Great for tweens and teens too. The acting is very good and the costumes and d&eacute;cor seem to fit the times.	6
525	Haven't watch it yet.  just replacing my tape but will be watching it soon.  Thank you for having the dvd.	6
526	The cast in this edition is wonderful, especially like Susan Sarandon as the mother of the girls.  A wonderful classic brought to life.	6
527	This movie brings all the joys of home on to the screen it is so diverse also it is great as a holiday movie or just a hot summer day when their is noting to do Claire Danes is great you really feel for her a treat for all  ages.	1
528	I first got Little Women from the library and I loved it so much that I bought it several hours later after work.I am a big fan of the book and I am glad that they stayed very close to it. The scenery and the score tie the movie together beautifully. I like how they stayed away from casting beauty queens and hunks but chose realistic people. This is a must see for anyone who likes the book, period pieces, or just good old-fashioned movies. Marmee can be a little preachy about the rights of woman but she was in the book to. All in all, it is very good entertainment.	6
529	I liked the first half, but in the second half Jo becomes a mealy mouth girly girl. And everyone who was surprised that it is a good movie never read the book.	6
530	Of all the versions of Little Women that I have seen, Gillian Armstrong's is the best!  She definitely chose her actors/actresses well - the cast includes: Winona Ryder (Jo), Claire Danes (Beth), Trini Alvrado (Meg), Kristen Dunst (Amy), Christian Bale (Laurie), Susan Sarandon (Marmee), and Gabriel Bryne (Professor Bhaer).  What an astounding performance they gave - this movie made me laugh, cry, and feel for the characters each and every time I watched it!  . . . And though some of my favorite scenes from the book were missing, it still portrays the characters extremely well.  I love this movie and highly recommend this to all Little Women fans, the people who didn't bother to read Little Women, and everyone else!	3
531	I love amazon prime and now I get to watch my favorite movie of all times anytime I want without having to dig out the DVD. Thanks, Amazon. You rock!	6
532	well i gave this movie a 1 star but if i could i would have gave it a 0. although the acting is good this film is so boring you can't even concentrate on it.  I tried to sit through it but you talk about boring. i  mean come on.  but maybe its just me but if your thinking of buying or  renting i would pass on it unless your into boring movies	41
533	This is a great movie to watch any time of year, but especially around the holidays.  The all-star cast, including Wynona Ryder, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, and Kirsten Dunst give amazing performances that feel like you're watching a real life drama play out.  Just be careful, make sure the kleenex are nearby.  A must-have!	4
534	This movie is horribly written, horribly cast, horribly directed and poorly acted. It seems that they just took several young actresses popular at the time and dumped them into the movie with no thought at all about whether or not they fit the part or were capable of playing the roles. I think it is interesting to note that none of the actresses playing the sisters have had successful careers. None of them became big stars. The movie leaves out some of the best scenes in the book completely. One of the most touching things in the book is the relationship between Beth and Mr. Lawrence - totally ignored here. And, Beth is just too big for the role, not gentle enough. There is no really clearly drawn difference in the sisters. For several scenes I couldn't tell Meg and Jo apart. Now, if you never read the book I guess you might enjoy this movie but if you have read the book, many times as I have, then you are going to be horrified. Winona Ryder is a joke as Jo and all the other sisters are also terrible casting. There was no narrative by Jo in the book so why have they dragged it in here. I won't even mention Eric Stoltz as Mr. Brook. Somebody must have been on drugs when they cast him in that role. The movie skips over a lot of things that are important to character development and to the story. It's like a caricature of the story made to sell tickets to young people who have never read any book much less this one.  The scenes where Jo kisses Professor Baer at the opera and in the boarding house are ridiculous. No well brought up young woman in that time would dream of doing such a thing.  A kiss would have been permitted only if they were formally engaged. And, if the children's mother caught a glimpse of a romantic relationship between the governess and one of the roomers, Jo would have been out of the house in record time and so would he. Who on earth writes this crap. The nondescript father of the family finally shows up in a couple of scenes but I don't recall him ever saying anything. If you want to see "Little Women" then get the original with June Allison as Jo and Peter Lawford as Laurie. Margaret O'Brien just IS Beth. Elizabeth is a really "dead on" Amy and Janet Leigh is just right as the very proper Meg. See that movie, then you'll be able to see what is so wrong with this film.	11
535	Little Women is a classic, and this version of it is my favorite. I love Winona Ryder in it. Actually I love the performances of all the actors and actresses in this movie. It's just one of those feel good movies, and I always save it to watch at Christmas time. I already owned it on VHS, but wanted to have it on DVD. My daughters and I watch this movie every year and love it. We have lots of favorite quotes from this one! (Jo, how could you? Your one beauty!)	6
536	This is an excellent movie, with great acting and a warm storyline.  Such a classic tale, that has embraced young girls for generations and generations.  I loved the book when I was a child, and when seeing this movie, it brought back all those wonderfully warm emotions to surface again.  This movie is like a visit from an old friend.  However, if you have not read the book, I think you'll still find it enjoyable.  The movie differs from the book, but I don't want to give anything away, so I cannot elaborate on what is different.Watch this movie with your daughters!  It was a wonderful mother-daughter bonding movie... don't miss it!	6
537	This is an all time favorite of mine! It is an incredibly inspiring story for young girls! This movie will always be a staple in my movie collection!	6
538	have loved this story for so long and love this particular version the most be ready to laugh and cry with this one	6
539	A wonderful, touching story of love, family, friendship, loss, and change.  After reading the book many times I did not think a movie could capture the same feelings.  But this one did, and that's saying a lot for my  favorite book. Hearing the song &quot;For the Beauty of the Earth&quot;  brings me to tears now.  Thanks for the memories.	1
540	It's a sad commentary on the state of political correctness when a book written in the 19th century has to be &quot;updated&quot; instead of being preserved as a precious reminder of times gone by. Are filmmakers so concerned with the bottom line that they don't think viewers are capable of recognizing a historical setting for what it is? The virtue of the novel is in its message - that love is eternal, surpassing youth, beauty, and riches. What part of that message can't be understood by a modern audience without &quot;sanitizing it for our protection&quot; against mores of bygone days? Why must we be hit on the head with the Anvil of Political Consciousness in a story where those notions had yet to be brought to the fore?If the people making this movie had been truly interested in finding feminism in Louisa May Alcott's text, then they missed the boat in three enormous ways:1. They made Jo the prettiest girl. That casting move left all of her lines about being an awkward tomboy sound as if she were fishing for compliments. What would have been so terrible about having someone less model-waif-starlet take the role? Go back and watch June Allyson and Katherine Hepburn in their turns as Jo - they weren't prettied up by the makeup artists and photographers, and it makes them all the stronger. By making Jo so lovely, the film accidentally moves against feminism by falling into the stereotype that even &quot;little&quot; women have to be beautiful. (To be fair, they also make Professor Bhaer unrecognizably handsome, missing the point for the male as well as female characters.)2. They ignored the subtle textual references about Marmee having as severe a temper as Jo. Instead of showing Marmee shouting out a window about not wearing corsets, why not show her working to control her emotions for the good of her family? Why not show her desire to work for the betterment of the poor as an outlet for her frustration over being left at home? Can you imagine what Susan Sarandon could have done with material like that?3. I'll grant that it would be hard to portray the changes in Amy, because in the novel most of them are happening in description rather than in her actions. Simply changing actresses in mid-stream isn't enough - we should have seen her growth from inside, her desire to become a good person rather than a rich one. Instead of seeing Laurie as her just reward for having made such a difficult journey, as we do in the book, it comes across as irony that someone so selfish should wind up with the rich boy next door.Thanks, but no thanks - I'll go back to Katherine Hepburn or June Allyson (even though in the latter version it's obvious Joan Bennett was pregnant when she portrayed Amy), and take my message undiluted.	81
541	It's not the A&E; Pride and Prejudice version when it comes to accuracy, but the care the screenwriters went to in order to make this true to the book (yet interesting to a film audience in ways that a straight book-film version would not have allowed) is what makes this movie such a masterpiece.  The most important and memorable scenes are made dutifully true to Alcott's original, and the actors are almost always believable (older Laurie seems a little forced at times, and that is honestly my only acting complaint).However, much of the dialogue is very soft, and while I don't remember having this issue the first time I saw the movie (about six years ago), I recently watched it again and found that I was looking at the subtitles a lot since I couldn't hear the full sentence.  I am not quite 20, so I think it is less of a problem of my own hearing as it is the fault of track editing.When I first watched this movie, I was moved to reread the book, and found it much more enjoyable than the first time I read it.  After again seeing the movie, I hope to be able to read the book yet again - it just has that effect!	2
542	ALTHOUGH I LOVED THIS MOVIE, IT HAS A TON MISSING ALSO, COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL.  THERE IS NO PARTOF THE MOVIE END, WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED, AND STARTED THE BOYS SCHOOL,	1
543	This is one of my most favorite Christmas movies. It's not exactly a holiday movie but takes place during the holidays. It's a total work of art...beautiful filled with memorable characters. It really does the book justice.	6
544	To be honest I was a bit wary of watching another "remake" of Louisa May Alcott's book "Little Women." I had seen the versions with Kate Hepburn, June Allyson and the NBC television version with Susan Dey. However upon a friend's urging I checked this version out from the library to watch. After viewing the movie all I can say is this is a delightful interpretation of the timeless classic. The movie was well cast, scripted,directed and scored. The movie flows flawlessly from beginning to end. I have no idea why this movie was given a PG rating it is definitely a "family film." This movie is a great follow up to reading the classic story.	5
545	This is a great book for anyone to keep in their library.  I've read it twice and watched the movie many times.	6
546	My favorite movie - powerful acting - costumes true to period - details adhered to - Feel all characters accurately represented (with the exception of Laury). If you are only getting one Little Women purchase this one.	6
547	This is a great movie for an amazing book, I was very pleased with the price and quality from the DVD, its a classic every family with little girls should have!	6
548	I love this movie; it's a classic in my household. Although it doesn't follow the book, it is a very good movie for all families and people to enjoy.	6
549	This movie is one of my ABSOLUTE favorites!! I can't tell people how much I love this remake of the original. I never actually watched all of the original because I like this version better. The first time I saw this remake, I was 12, and I'm almost 19 now, I still watch it! I tend to watch it around Christmas or when it's cold and snowy outside because that was what the time of year it was when I saw the movie! I curl up infront of the tv, covered by a blanket, and a cup of hot cocoa. Everyone says they don't like this version because it doesn't compare to the book. Well to tell you all the truth, I prefer every movie over any book any day! I tend to not like books much anyway, so I like the movie. But this movie has been a favorite of mine, my mom's, my old school friends, and my young cousins! Even my brother watches it, and he's over 21! It's a fantastic movie, and I think everyone should see it!	1
550	The movie is great! It came on time and and it works just fine. There is really noting else to say!	6
551	Great service on delivery time, but unfortunately, the sound quality was bad. We started to watch the movie on Christmas eve, but had to stop because we couldnt hear the voices!!!! Disappointing...	1
552	Watch this movie on a Saturday afternoon all alone and eat lots of candy. Very nice movie, a good way to pass the time. Not to mention that you have the eye candy of Gabriel Byrne to munch on when things get dull.	2
553	I was SHOCKED when I saw this film. It seemed that on all fronts it had gotten nothing but praise and Oscar buzz! Did any of these people read the book?OK, the sets were great. The music was pretty good-most of the time (I don't like blaring piano solos during death scenes). But it was SO, SO UNFAITHFUL to Louisa May Alcott's story!Never once does Jo say "Christopher Columbus"! Where is her tomboy character? Now, I like feminine girls. I like being a feminine girl. I love the character of Meg. But a big part of the story of "Little Women" is Jo being feisty and defiant and rude and unladylike, and she struggles valiantly throughout the story to overcome her faults. The guiding principles of the Bible and "The Pilgrim's Progress" are KEY. Instead, there's this governing agenda in the film that throws in lines about transcendentalism and liberal feminism. They also deleted many, many scenes and events from the book and threw in these ridiculous plugs for womens' rights. Now, I believe in feminine equality, but that is not what "Little Women" is about!The cast was pretty bad. Jo could be quite good, and she picked up elements of Jo's character that many have left out, but she was generalized. Some of the distinctiveness of the character was lost.Meg was a disappointment. She is not just a silly, vain young thing. She is the moral strength in the sisters' relationship. She is a noble, upright young girl trying to live her life well and virtuously. A lot of that was left out in the film; instead, she is a boring, vaguely attractive dweeb that cannot hope to be figured out.You would think that if you got two separate actresses playing Amy, at least one of them would get it right. Guess again. The younger Amy is supposed to be twelve, and thinks that she is a grand lady. Instead, she acts like she was seven, and just a silly little girl. The real Amy is meticulously attentive to her speech and deportment, this Amy says "Blast!". And the older Amy is too tall to be a little girl, and too naive to be a woman, so she doesn't know what to do with herself. At tea she may be graceful, but at acting she is awkward.Laurie talks like he has laryngitis, and desperately needs a haircut.John Brooke is a fiasco. He acts like a zombie and looks like a freak.Aunt March and Mr. Laurence are scarcely present at all in the film. They are key adult characters at the formation of the little women, but the relationship between Mr. Laurence and Beth was virtually destroyed, confined to merely the gift of the piano.Professor Bhaer missed it. He's supposed to be a nice, bumbling, old German guy with a big brown beard and terrible attempts at English. Instead, he is a cultured, would-be-suave philosopher who is much too forward in his relationship with Jo.The director, I noticed, loves chopping up scenes so that there's very little flow, you don't know where this scene takes place, and why does she love close-ups on people's feet??This film could have been beautiful. It could have been a masterpiece. I was looking forward to an equivalent of the film version of "Anne of Green Gables". But it's so shallow and unsympathetic to the original story, that I was glad that I had been raised watching the 1933 version. At some points, this version can be very nice and enjoyable. I loved Beth. I liked Jo. But if you're going to make a film of "Little Women", then please do it right and read the book.	30
554	This movie, the story line as well as the scenery and music, is like balm to my busy frazzled soul. Also, it just wouldn't be Christmas until I watch it with my daughters. I love this version!	6
555	This is a movie you want to watch over and over again.  It warms you heart and soul.  It is a good movie for the whole family.  It is a wonderful way to summarize the classic book.	1
556	This is a truly wonderful movie. It is a beautiful adaptation of a beloved book. The film strays from the book a little, mostly by rearranging the order in which things occur. It also gives Marmee (Sarandon) a feminist twist, which is fine by me, but may bother some purists. I was also dissapointed that they pratically obliterated the character of Mr. Laurence. Ryder does a great job as Jo, capturing her firey spirit. Gabriel Byrne was absolutely perfect as Professor Bhaer! This is one of my favorite roles to watch him in and his final scene with Jo is so touching and beautiful, it just makes my day! The rest of the cast was wonderful, with the exception of Samantha Mathis. Her portrayal of the older Amy was so stilted and cold, I couldn't understand for the life of me where the younger Amy went and why in the WORLD Laurie chose her. Little Women is a beautiful film with a gorgeous score that keeps you suspended in its world. This is a great movie that everyone can enjoy during the holidays, or whenever.	4
557	While all of the major events from the book occurred in this movie version of Little Women, the &#34;feel&#34; was much different.  The characters were skewed from their original personalities and values, changing the story completely even though the same people married, died, etc.  Since I love the book so much, I thought that this movie could only be satisfactory to someone who has never read the book at all.	6
558	We loved the book and can't stop watching the movie!  My daughter is 5 - year - old and it is one of her favorites!	6
559	It's a coming of age story during the civil war era with a perfect mesh of cast, immpecable screenplay, and directoral genius. It is mostly from the perspective of the second oldest daughter, although it does follow all four girls over the period of about 10 years. It is a movie that I can watch over and over again and still cry and laugh every time. My Suggestion: This is a must see for all you ladies.	6
560	Louisa May Alcott's Classic novel of sisterly love is brought to life in a truly remarkable motion picture production.Little Women is a vibrant,lavish version of this timeless classic.The costumes,sets and acting are very well done indeed.I feel the films strongest point however is Winona Ryder's engaging portrayal of the storys main character &quot;Jo&quot;.It's although Louisa May Alcott had her in mind to play this part when she wrote the story over a hundred years ago.The story of a young woman irevocably engaged in her talent and passion for storytelling and the loved ones around her.An acting triumph for Wynona Ryder!A great family film and also a film to enjoy with whoever you happen to be watching with.A truly inspiring Tale,I loved it!	2
561	This is a childhood favorite for me. I recently watched the classic film as well and love both of them.	6
562	Christian Bale is great, Winona Ryder is the best she's ever been, Susan Sarandon brings tremendous complexity to what could have been an overly familiar character, Gabriel Byrne is terrific and very different from anything else he's done, etc. right down the line through the whole cast.Gillian Armstrong's direction is seamless and invisible in the strongest way, getting the best from her actors, cinematographer, designers, and the story itself, while never making you conscious of all the style and tone she's bringing to it.While it threatens to feel to Hollywood/sappy/ period-stogy for the first few minutes, stay with it., It quickly warms up and comes to vibrant life, turning into a wonderfully winning proto- feminist story, very touching, and full of unexpected moments and twists.One of my very favorite period family films.	6
563	The transaction was seamless from ordering to delivery. The product arrived in good condition and well ahead of my expected timeline.Thanks	6
564	The ensemble cast in this movie is especially brilliant.  It's a classic movie with a wonderful story suitable for young children and teens.	6
565	I have read the the book for the first time two years ago, and fell in love with it! After I read the book, It watched the movie. I was so surprised that it was really similar to the book. And added a few things that wasn't but made it look perfect. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on this great classic novel turned into a great movie!	6
566	This is a warm, wonderful movie and the DVD is jam-packed with extras! I recommend it highly! Great family movie.	2
567	This is my favorite movie to watch when I am feeling ill or the weather outside is a little too cold to bear. Winona Ryder's portrayal of Jo March is stunningly perfect. A great movie to snuggle up on the couch and watch.	6
568	Louisa May Alcott's novel of sisterly love is brought to life in classic fashion.Little Women is a vibrant tribute to this timeless story.The acting,directing and costumes are very well done.While some changes were made from the book I feel the films strongest point is Winona Ryder's engaging portrayal of the storys main character "Jo".It's although Ms Alcott had her in mind to play this part when she wrote the story over a hundred years ago.The story of a young woman irevocably engaged in her talent and passion for storytelling and the loved ones around her.An acting triumph for Wynona Ryder!A great family film and also one to enjoy with whoever you happen to be watching with.	2
569	I love it! Such a classic movie with amazing music. Also, you really can't beat the price. I'm very pleased with this purchase.	1
570	Little Women was my favorite book as a child, and I still re-read it at least yearly as an adult for the comfort it gives me. I've probably read it 50 times over the last 30 years. I have also seen every filmed version of the book that I could, and was never completely satisfied.  I held my breath as this version of the story rolled onto the screen.I was enchanted. It was all there, from the scenery to the costumes to the characters.  Winona Ryder perfectly captured my fiery Jo, Kirsten Dunst the vanity of Amy, and Clair Danes the real depths of Beth, without any of them becoming a caricature. I loved the way Trini Alvarado, an actress new to me, potrayed the earnest, wistful, practical Meg. The passionate, fun-loving yet moody Laurie was perfectly found in Christian Bale, and the only difference between Gabriel Byrne and the professor I've always imagined is that Gabriel Byrne is more handsome. Aunt March had more dimensionality to her than in the book (and what a joy to see Mary Wickes in the role!). But the spirit that Louisa May Alcott gave to her book was caught ethereally in Marmee, as portrayed by Susan Sarandon.  She was the real foundation of the film, and expanding her character was the wisest decision Gilllian Armstrong made. Yes, some of the things in the film were not in the book, but they were so consistent with the story, so central to the March family philosophy, that perhaps they should have been!  I never thought that my beloved book could be improved upon, but it has been in this film. I also wish to mention the sets, the cinematography and the music, all which added so much to make my imagined world of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy become real.  Thank you to everyone who worked on this precious film.	26
571	This is a wonderful adaptation of a classic story. The acting is superb as well as the costuming. Heart-warming, this is the kind of movie I would love to share with my daughter.	1
572	Oh! I'm such a fan of Louisa May Alcott! I have grown up on 'Little Women' and its sequels - 'Good Wives', 'Little Men' and 'Jo's Boys'. I rented this DVD twice and wasn't disappointed! The movie itself is a treat, but this DVD is better still! I have written a review of the film on Imdb, so I don't feel like talking about the film per se. It is a gem of a film. I agree that the writer and the director have taken a few artistic licences, but the goodness and essense of Alcott is retained and it shines through!What I most liked about this film were the sets and the music. I especially loved the latter! Thomas Newman's score is haunting and just heartrendingly beautiful! The acting by everyone is just perfect. Trini Alvarado, with her sweet face and her curls is the quintessential Meg! Kirsten Dunst, whose line I've used as my title, is really amazing as Amy! Winona Ryder has given a really admirable performance as Jo!Gillian Armstrong's commentary is very interesting! It's a little ironic to know that most of the crew that worked to bring this *very* American novel to screen were Australians and that the film was almost entirely short in Canada! Another interesting tidbit is that Meryl Streep was also Armstrong's choice for Marmee. She first offered it to Susan Sarandon and she accepted in spite of being adviced not to do so by her agents! There are more such fascinating things in Armstrong's commentary.Then of course you have the choice of watching the entire film with only the music playing! This would probably not make sense with some other film with ordinary music, but over here, the music is such an inextricable part of the film, it adds so many layers and brings in so much beauty and nostalgia to the film that it is quite an experience to just hear the music! Thomas Newman must have outdone himself with this score!There'a a short Behind the Scenes feature which is also quite enjoyable! In all this DVD is a *real* treat! A Must-Have for anyone who has liked the film! Long live Alcott in our minds and let all her books be adapted just as brilliantly! :)	3
573	This version of &quot;Little Women&quot; is quite fine, really, and there is very little that I can find to criticise.  Winona Ryder does a good job as the independent Jo, the other actresses are also very good in their roles. Susan Sarandon is, alas, wasted in the role of Marmee but pretty much any good actress would be-- Marmee is a 2-dimensional character, all kindliness and charity.  Marmee is not much of a role, and Ms. Sarandon does not try to make it any more than it is because it would not add anything to the story to try to find additional dimensions.  Excellent actress that Ms. Sarandon is, she also knows what an ensemble cast is supposed to be and she does what is needed without upstaging anybody or anything.  If I wanted to go looking for problems in this rendition, I would have to say that the only one would be with Winona Ryder as Jo.  She was really too young to be playing that part, which is more than that of simply a tom-boyish girl awkwardly trying to find herself an identity as a woman.  Winona has done some really fine work in several films, and she certainly isn't bad at all in this one [especially in the beginning of the movie], but she is out of her depth in 1994 playing a young woman in love with a much older man.  Gabriel Byrne is as close to perfect as you can possibly get in his role as Professor Behr, but Winona is hardly more than a teenaged girl and her responses to him are a bit &quot;off&quot;.  I think it's because she was so young here and life experience was working against her for the latter part of the film.  Otherwise, the film was tastefully and artfully done.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  It's definitely worth your time to watch.	3
574	Among many other things, the music is what makes this movie fantastic.  It is by far the best version of Little Women I've seen simply because of the music.  And Winona Ryder makes the perfect Jo.	6
575	Jarring Note #1: The screenplay does a disservice to Alcott's book by including many references to women's rights and feminism. Sorry, it's just not in the original work, and you lose a large part of the point of Alcott's message that way: the little women are being taught how to be proper mothers and supports to their husbands, which requires them to work constantly on self-improvement--that's why there are so many references to &quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot; in the novel. If the writers wanted to flesh out Marmee's character more, they might have done what none of the other writes had done yet, which is focus on the curbed volatile temper of Marmee--indeed, Marmee sees Jo as the daughter most like herself.  Jarring Note #2: Beth. I know many reviewers praised this actress's work, but I couldn't get past her height. Beth is usually thought of as fragile and slight; that's why it's not hard to imagine that she might die. This Beth looks like a strapping farm lass; I half expected her to go out and clear a field of heavy rocks. I remember when I saw this in the movies, one of the attending doctors makes a comment about &quot;the child&quot;, to which  one of my companions responded, &quot;Child? What child?&quot; She was completely mystified as to the person being identified. So this Beth has physical volume working against her. Jarring Note #3: Changing Amys. For all the crucial scenes building characters in the first half of the movie, we have one Amy, and then another Amy shows up at Meg's wedding, takes the Grand Tour with Aunt March, and marries Laurie. Huh?  This completely undercuts everything that has gone before. Why not hire just one actress and be done with it? Here also we lose Alcott's intention that  the four sisters are each on a journey of self-improvement. That first Amy didn't get her rightful reward of going to Europe and marrying a rich man. The second Amy says hard things to Laurie in Europe, sitting in judgement on him--well, since you get the impression that they've only just met, who is she to say all those things? He didn't grow up with HER! Bad idea all around.  Still in all, it is a beautifully filmed movie, which included some scenes from the book not in the other movies, like when Meg goes to a society party and is persuaded to act the flirt, only to be horribly embarrassed by Laurie's stern reproof. This is important  in particular because Meg gets short shrift most of the time, and is the least developed cinematically of the sisters.  So for atmospheric reasons of accurate costuming, sets, and cinematography this is a good &quot;Little Women&quot;, for other purposes, consult Hepburn/Allyson.	7
576	Purchased this film to replace a VHS. Wonderful story of a family growing up during hard times in Massachusetts. They share some of the most cherished and painful memories of self-discovery as they are guided through issues of independence, romance and virtue.Great performances by Susan Sarandon (Marmee), Winona Ryder (Jo), Trini Alvarado (Meg),Claire Danes (Beth, Kirsten Dunst (Amy). Also pleasant additions of Gabriel Byrne and Christian Bale.	6
577	There have been countless film adaptations of "little Women" including one that stars Katherine Hepburn and one that stars Elizabeth Taylor.  The question is then, "Why did we need a new one?"  Although, I am certain the world would not have ended if this version were not made, it is so rich and beautiful to watch it would have made my life a lot more boring without it.I admit, I have not yet read the book, my friend has, and admits that there are some significant differences in this version as compared to the novel (as in the way that Beth passes away), but that they do not detract from the movies enjoyment.The most interesting thing about this film is that if you have watched the commentaries (which are farely decent) and have watched the film close to as much as I have (50+ times), you begin to appreciate it more and more.  The richness in the performances by all of the actors, especially Christian Bale as Laurie and Trina Alvarado as Meg.  Besides the performances, the visuals are a feast to the eyes!  The costume designs are georgeous and the sets are lush and recall a time that was less complicated by housing developments.Even if you cann't enjoy the acting or the costumes the story itself is beautiful.  It tells a tale of the bonds of family, especially between sisters.  Jo is the most spirited of the bunch, and as she says in the beginning of the movie "Longs for transofrmation", but at the same time fears change, and does not wish her family to be broken of up her sisters being married off.  She enjoys her fellowship with her sisters as it is; they put on theatricals in their attic and print a periodical with male psuedonyms for themselves where Jo publishes her scandolous stories.  It is the first half of the film that is such a joy to watch, the girls all really feel like they are sister and you feel their pain and their sorrows as if you were there with them.If there is one complaint I have about the film, it is how even when their father returns (and they had been missing him dearly), he feels as though he is not there and as though he lived in the shadows. Also, it does downplay the religious apects (according to my friend) in favor of a more femministic spirit which at times can be somewhat over the top (such as with Marmee's statements about restrictive corsets and nedle work). However, these are my only major qualms with the film."Little Women", however, with its timeless celebration of the bonds of family and the fear of change speaks to us today even in a startingly different society with little or no social restrictions.  If you enjoy watching movies about family, or growing up, or just like good movies than "Little Women" is the movie for you!God Bless ~Amy	3
578	Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it.  Her teacher had been reading the novel to them in class and so when I mentioned to her their was a movie she got all excited.  So it was a big surprise when she got the gift.	6
579	Little Women is a book classic, unforgettable for a great deal of readers, and Amstrong delivers an amazing remake, with beautiful performances, breathtaking scenery and stunning soundtrack. A true pearl!	2
580	Little Women is a heart-warming story of four sisters who remain close despite the many trials that they are faced with.  From refusing a proposal to finding a place in an unfamilar city--Little Women is filled with  laughter, sorrow and tears as we, the viewers, watch Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy  go on.  I recommend this film to anyone, despite age or gender!	1
581	For a modern enactment of one of my favorite books - LITTLE WOMEN - this was a delight.  It was very much similar to the book and the actors seems suited for their roles.  The scenes, costumes and backgrounds were fetching.  It is a very cheery Little Women and that's okay, except for the death scene, of course.  The picture on the cover of this DVD encapsulates the tone of the film.  It's upbeat.  It may be a trifle cheerier than the book itself, but just a trifle.  Most fans of LITTLE WOMEN would enjoy it.	1
582	This is a lovely version of the Alcott book, although I think my most favorite part is the music. I had to go out and buy the soundtrack the moment I finished seeing the film! By and large I like the performances, although I didn't think Christian Bale was as convincing as Laurie grew older. Two things that did bother me: Jo saying &quot;you're dead&quot; to Amy after the burning of her book and Marmee being the one to cure Beth. You didn't say &quot;you're dead&quot; and &quot;I'll kill you&quot; in those days as flippantly as we do now. And Marmee in the book had faults; Gillian Armstrong seems to want to deify the character instead. However, the lush production, the music, and the other characters make up for most of the faults.One thing that did make me smile were people talking about how Armstrong put &quot;feminist tracts&quot; in everyone's mouths! They evidently have read no Alcott except LITTLE WOMEN, because most of the &quot;feminist&quot; lines come from other Alcott novels. For instance, Marmee's comments about corsets come directly out of EIGHT COUSINS! I believe AN OLD FASHIONED GIRL was also quoted somewhere.	5
583	My memory of the movie (when it was released) was how wonderful the scenery (filmed in British Columbia) and the period costumes were in the movie! They really set the tone for the film. When I purchased and watched the DVD, I remembered the performances by the many young upcoming stars were what carried the story: Christian Bale, Winona Ryder, Claire Dane and Kirsten Dunst. And the movie was not without good seasoned actors and actresses like Susan Sarandon. I believe this is a very good realistic rendition of the story.	2
584	Gillian Anderson's LITTLE WOMEN attempts not so much to capture the essense of Louisa May Alcott's original story as to use it as a springboard.  It might have been better if she had transferred the story to a different time, or otherwise re-framed it so as to give herself more liberty to change things around.  I myself would not have minded a version of LITTLE WOMEN where Laurie and Jo DO run away, Beth sneakily brings in much needed cash as dance hall pianist, and Professor Bhaer finally learns to mind his own business.  But instead, screenwriter Robin Swicord drains the drama and momentum from the original by pointless alteration, but is still required to hit major plot points, and so cannot create anything new and satisfactory.What made Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN, despite the moralizing, something children have wanted to read for one and a half centures now was its vivid portrait of passionate adolescence: Jo's famous temper, Laurie's rebelliousness, Amy's spite, Meg's longings - even what lurked beneath Beth's shyness.  Anderson jettisons this anger and passion for a genteel and straight-laced Art-House flick about ladylike little feminists.  Alcott famously disparaged her books for children as "moral pap for the young", but LITTLE WOMEN had honesty and substance.  Anderson ignores the substance in favor of "moral pap" - albeit politically correct and feminist pap - washed down with tony sentimentality.  The only notes of truth are struck by the performances.The girls are just not the same girls, with mixed results.  Kirsten Dunst - fresh from INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE - is a superb child-Amy, but is written as a sly vixen with designs on Laurie, which ruins the honest connection between them that was so important later.  Adult Samantha Mathis plays Amy as a dense zombie.  Trini Alvarado brings tremendous grace and womanliness to Meg, which is really nice actually, except that Meg is supposed to be an unsure adolescent.  Winona Ryder's Jo is interestingly different, which is to say she isn't a rebellious tomboy with a wild temper and a burning literary passion, but a thoughtful-if-pouty wannabe Liberal Arts Major.  Beth is supposed to be a frail girl struggling mightily with her timidity: Claire Daines gives us a sturdy lass placidly devoid of inner conflict.  Thus we must lurch through the plot of LITTLE WOMEN, without getting the Little Women themselves as compensation.Christian Bale, as boy-next-door Laurie, does a good job of suggesting caged wildness, and makes the most of the few poignant lines which are all that is left of Laurie's tempestuous relationship with his grandfather.  But he is just a little too old, too smug, and too smarmy.  Alcott's lonely, emotionally-deprived teenager is barely hinted at.  Rather, he has become a representative of "Men", which you know is just not good.  In the book, Laurie's reaction to seeing Meg dolled up like a sexpot was sudden bashfulness and defensive rudeness.  Here he is a suave sexist oaf who sees Meg's new finery as the opportunity for a spot of sexual harassment.  Ew!  Why?  The point of Laurie and Jo's dance, in the book, was to convey the pleasure of meeting a soulmate one could show one's real self to without worrying about being "presentable" or "proper".  Here, their dance is rendered somewhat awkward by the fact that Jo only knows how to lead.  This alters the whole meaning of the scene, implying Anderson sees it as a power struggle rather than a moment of connection.  And it's so dismally clich&eacute;.  "Oh, they are both too strong-willed so . . .."  You know something?  Being weak-willed and knowing how to dance backwards have NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with one another.In the directors's commentary, Anderson describes Alcott's Marmee as the "perfect" mother.  She was not!  Anderson obviously doesn't think the March parents were perfect either, as her version replaced Marmee with Susan B. Anthony, and shuts Father up completely.  But instead of admitting it and portraying Marmee as a flawed human being, she simply replaces her own PC notion of perfection for that supposedly offered by Alcott.  Susan Sarandon does as amazing a job as one could possibly wish, considering that she's being asked to play a marble statue instead of a woman.  Some have suggested that Saradon's portrayal would have been more convincing in another era, but I disagree.  Her Marmee says nothing feminists didn't say at the time - in essays and speeches.  Alcott's trashy adventure-potboiler A LONG FATAL LOVE CHASE has quite a few feminist speeches, and as ALFLC is scarcely attempting naturalistic realism, they fit in just fine.  No, it is Marmee's cardboard-cutout supermom-hood which rings false - in any era.There is inherent feminism to be found in Alcott's work, to those interested in Alcott's work.  But those people do not include Anderson and Swicord.  Scene after scene is rewritten to ignore and replace the actual story rather than intepret or illuminate it.  John Brooke takes Meg to the theatre, only to spout stock rubbish about how sinful, immodest and unladylike actresses are.  Writer Jo faces sexist discrimination from New York publishers, and discusses female sufferage with Herr Professor.  Meg and Sally Moffat argue over child silk laborers.  The doctor throws in a line about bleeding, and throws in the towel on a patient who is promptly saved by Super-Marmee.  Amy's doting schoolmaster who very reluctantly struck her for disobedience is now The Sexist Educational Establishment, and is given that line comparing female students to female cats which is scarcely what a poor man who earned his living educating young ladies would say.  Thus generic Victorian clich&eacute;s gleaned from speed-reading a few history books replace the situations created by a woman who was actually THERE, and incidents borrowed from Alcott's life are thrown in without context or point.  I'm surprised nobody found a runaway slave in the oven.  Or did I blink?The script is so ham-handed that on the occasion we do get something of Alcott's, it no longer makes sense.  Take the skating accident.  In the book, Jo is so furious with Amy that she refuses to speak to her, even to warn her of thin ice.  Then she freezes in shock when Amy falls through, leaving the rescue to Laurie.  The line "How could I be so horrible?  Thank God for Laurie!" would therefore make perfect sense.  In the FILM, Jo knows nothing about rotten ice, is blameless for Amy's accident, and is as quick to the rescue as Laurie.  But Swicord includes the now-senseless line anyway.  This book chapter ended with Jo's realization that "perfect" Marmee had as fiery a temper as Jo herself.  This liberated Jo from her self-loathing and despair, permited her to forgive both herself and Amy, and the chapter ended on a kiss.  The subtextual message is that we manage our darker feelings better when we acknowledge them, that we strangle our ability for love when we don't acknowledge our anger, and that there is no such thing as the perfect woman or mother who lacks the full range of human feelings.  That is more feminist and timeless than whining about corsets, and even has something to do with the plot and characters.  So of course it's not included.Another chapter that would have rewarded feminist interest was when unfashionable Meg allows herself to get nicely dolled up at Moffat's, only to find she has ruined herself in the eyes of conservative acquaintances.  But in the film, Meg looks EXACTLY like all the other girls present, and never hears any censure for crossing an invisible line of modesty.  She merely seems dressed for the occasion.  Yet she allows herself to be thoroughly shamed by Laurie, and (in an even creepier scene) cries repentantly while taking off her makeup.  What could easily have been a commentary on the eternal feminine double-bind instead comes across as a Puritanical slam against femininity itself.  Marmee's advice on modesty, in the BOOK, addressed Meg's need to protect her self-respect and the integrity of her relationships with men in the face of the "marriage market" mentality, but she specifically defended Meg's desire for prettiness and admiration as right and harmless.  Anderson's message amounts to "Men are Beasts, girls!  So COVER UP!" which doesn't seem terribly progressive somehow.  Still, the scene where Meg, Jo, and Marmee discuss the incident is among those where the actresses transcend their material.This movie is not BAD, mind.  It is at it's best showing the girl's at play, doing the Pickwick Club, or putting on amateur theatricals written by Jo.  But some scenes are too stupid for words.  Bale and Mathis deserve awards for professionalism for enacting the lamest screen courtship ever allowed to succeed.  I don't expect Mr. March to get any LINES, but an award winning director should make the actor look line a man in his own home, rather than an Alzheimer's patient who wandered onto the set.  A character in England reads a letter from America, throws it aside UNFINISHED when he gets to the dramatic part, and rushes out the door to catch a boat to Vienna.  Meg doesn't tell her own sister she's pregnant in private letter because "One doesn't speak of such things".  Amy doesn't burn Jo's novel in the heat of anger, then grow fearful and repentant by the time Jo comes home.  She burns the novel AND acts fearful and repentant all in the same 60 second period.  Then there is the skating scene, wherein the "rotten ice" is clearly ROCK SOLID as though the hole were sawed out by a cartoon character, and which bears the weight of two fully grown rescuers who suicidally throw themselves down side-by-side next to the edge.  They then wave a oar around just because there was an oar in the book, and not because they are using it to any purpose.  If Anderson ever directs an action film, I'm not seeing it.Last but not least, "strong-minded" Jo doesn't come up with the idea for Plumfield on her own.  She does it because Super-Marmee TOLD her to.  We are dealing with the sort of twisted minds who read LITTLE WOMEN and thought: "Gee, that wasn't bad, but Marmee should have put HER oar in a bit more often."	11
585	It is such an amazing movie! This is my second copy of this movie. I loved watching it so much that I had to get a newer copy in order to enjoy some more. The sister who plays the piano was super. All the sisters in this movie had such wonderful chemistry. Christian Bale was outstanding. I love how he came to maturity. He loves Jo so much and then he was able to marry Amy. This movie is so much fun to watch!	6
586	I have seen this movie before and loved it. I was just in the mood. I think all of the actors played their roles beautifully. It is warm and loving story.	1
587	i seen this movie on tv ,fell in love, and what can i say bought it and in great condtion!!	6
588	Bought this for our daughter since we already owned one.  We watch it every Christmas season and it brings back memories of the first time we saw it together as a family&#60;3	6
589	A beautiful movie that comes from a beautiful book. Rarely do I find a movie that is better than the book. This is one of those movies.The casting was excellent, the music was inspiring. The story was as touching and moving as the first time I read the book. I love the version of the movie starring Kathrine Hepburn, but this one surpasses even that in all its creativity and imagination. Small detours from the book are hardly noticible, and are forgotten in the splendor of this already enchanting movie. Truely worth all five stars.	2
590	This is a timeless classic of historical fiction that tells a story of how it was for women during a time when strength of character and imagination were of up-most importance to live a fulfilling and purposeful life.	6
591	The product came quickly and in good shape..I will use again..I was satisified..this says i have to use more words but this is all i have to say	6
592	Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a wonderful book and this is a beautiful rendition of the book.  It beautiful captures the warmth and complexity of the relationships! Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale bring depth and believability to the roles of Marmee and Laurie.  All of the actress playing the sisters are wonderful in their own ways. The only roles that could have been developed a bit more are Mr. March and Mr. Brooks, and that is because these are rather two dimensional characters in the book.I could watch this movie again and again!	6
593	ordered this because we were both autiditoining for this show. That way we can wathc it and know what play is like	1
594	I bought this video and expected it to be "NEW" (according to its description), but it was scratched. It skips at a certain point in the movie. I don't know if I'll buy anything from this seller again.	4
595	I took my girls to see this heartwarming early 1990's remake of Little Women at the movie theater.  I remember thinking the whole experience was a special gift to moms and daughters!We bring out the DVD out every year at Christmas and the soundtrack is a staple for our holiday music!  Now to have the book and the DVD together in a gift set is especially sweet.  Whatever changes made while transforming book to movie were done so subtly that the movie still gives great homage to Alcott's story of Jo and her sisters coming of age!  My girls are now 21 and 30 and we still get together once a year at Christmas time to bake cookies, have some hot chocolate, and enjoy this beautiful film- and what fun it is to see Winona Ryder, Christian Bale and Kristen Dunst at such young ages!  And as always, Susan Sarandon is tremendous as the wise and loving mother.  This movie has not lost any of its original wonder, and certainly has not become out of date as so many remakes can become!  I would highly recommend it to everyone!	6
596	How I wished I was a part of this family! So loving and close knit!Great acting and scenery.It seemed deeper than just acting.I simply loved it!	6
597	A classic story told with an all-star cast.  This is one of my seasonal favorites without a doubt, even though it isn't a Christmas movie, snuggling up by the fire with this tale is perfect!	6
598	This was a gift and as far as I know she loves it. Great for those who enjoy classic movies.	6
599	This movie is great for the whole family. It is a nice reliable movie that all ages would enjoy. I would definitely watch this movie if you havn't already. A++	4
600	This was received as posted.  New and still in clear wrapper.  Excellent movie.  Read the book for book club and thought the DVD would help in discussion. Thanks	6
601	She loves it, great movie, wonderful for young girls.  I wish there were more movies like this.  Easy for her to download onto her kindle	2
602	I remember seeing this movie in the theater, resigned to hating it, but I think that it's the best rendering of _Little Women_ ever done. Winona Ryder is better than Katharine Hepburn. The music is excellent.	6
603	When I was in film school I had a professor who would constantly show clips from Winona Ryder movies when demonstrating film style techniques.  Inevitably we ended up watching many moment from Little Women - more than I would have liked.  Nonetheless, my girlfriend loves this movie.  What can I say?  It's Little Women.  You either love it or you don't.	1
604	Love! Love! Love this adaptation of Little Women!	6
605	One has to ask, did we really need another version of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel?  Well, even if we didn't, we have to give director Gillian Armstrong a big round of applause for her beautifully filmed and acted LITTLE WOMEN.  Winona Ryder as Jo was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar and is exquisite in her role as the wanna be writer who chronicles the adventures of her family, particularly her relationship with her three sisters.  Susan Sarandon does a nice turn as Marmee, the girls devoted mother, whose husband is off at war and rules the family with a smooth assuredness and grace.  Mary Wickes is fine as Aunt March; this late actress who was so memorable in the SISTER ACT films brings a naughty edge to her role.  The casting is perfect:  Trini Alvarado as Meg, the rather bashful sister who ends up marrying a poor tutor (Eric Stoltz); Claire Dane is the quiet and doomed Beth, who feels "left behind" when her sisters go off on their own; Kirsten Dunst plays Amy as a youngster and her joyful youth and innocence is marvelous; Samantha Mathis does well in taking over Amy's role as a young woman.  Christian Bale (our new Batman) does a nice job as Laurie, the young man who woos Jo to no avail, and ultimately ends up with Amy.  I think the most disappointing aspect of this rendition is Gabriel Byrne's Professor Baer.  It is ironic that his relationship with Ryder is the movie's weakest and although it doesn't totally diminish its quality, I think a different actor might have made it a perfect version.  As it stands though, LITTLE WOMEN is an enjoyable movie, filled with the richness of the time and the familial love Alcott so delicately portrayed.	5
606	This is a great and touching version of the classic story. Beautifully filmed, a joy to watch. I will usually watch this twice a year around Thanksgiving and then again at Christmas. Also if your a soundtrack for movies fan I highly recommend this for your collection.	6
607	When I first saw this movie when I was little I diddn't understand what it was about but I watched it anyway. Later in life while cleaning out the movie case I poped it in and watched it. Later I found myself watching it over and over again about 50million times. I love it and It's deffinetly a classic. For younger viewers it might be a yawn but if you have a little bit of culture in you you'd ejoy this musically, beautiful film.	1
608	Enjoyed this version of the classic Little Women immensely.  Even my husband enjoyed it. I highly recommend.	6
609	This movie is ok, but I prefer the 1949 one with Elizabeth Taylor.  I hated Winona's acting, and I didn't like how Gabriel Byrne played Prof. Bhaer in this movie.  But good thing Christian Bale was in it.This one is ok, but the 1949 version is much better.	3
610	I love this version of Little Women. It is family friendly--no language or junk--a gem that our whole family could watch!	1
611	I first fell in love with the book as a child and thought this movie was a wonderful adaptation of Alcott's writing.  Definitely a feel-good, nostalgic movie.	6
612	I bought this DVD for my friend for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. She watched it 3 times over Christmas vacation. It was very reasonably priced and arrived in a timely manner.Little Women (Collector's Edition)	6
613	This has become a holiday tradition to watch this well acted holiday movie every year with the whole family.... You should add it to your collection.	6
614	I have watched Little Women many times. This collector's series was wonderful and I really enjoyed seeing it again. It's one of my favorites. I received the dvd just a few days after ordering. The seller was quick in sending it to me. That's all I can say except that I love that movie.	6
615	This was the perfect Christmas gift for my daughter in law.  It is a classic as well as a wonderful collector's series.	6
616	the movie did follow the book... BUT the story itself was absolutely absurd and illogical.the ending was unexpected and unreasonable; JO SHOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH LAURIE!!!!!!!!!Winona Ryder was horrible portraying Jo.The only good thing in this movie is Laurie (Christian Bale was fine tho!) and even he turned out weird!!!!	17
617	One of my favorite movies of all time, both for its beautiful cinematography and gentle humor. The director captures the period perfectly, and the acting is superb. It is one of the best family films to come out in the 90s. The world needs more high quality, wholesome movies like this! Bound to become a classic.	6
618	I feel this version of &quot;Little Women&quot; did Louisa May Alcott's book justice.  No, the film did not completely correspond with the book, but I can overlook that thanks to the beautiful musical score, the gorgeous scenery, and the superb acting talents of Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon.  I highly recommend this heartwarming film!	2
619	I didn't like this movie too much, I think the director and script writer took too much of the book and added too much of their own, in a way that spoils the movie.The movie flaws over the most important parts of the book, and on the other hand gives great attention to events invented by the script writer. Throughout the movie there is a feeling that the most important parts of the book pop out of nowhere, for two minutes, and then talentlessly cut-off for some invented event.In addition the movie is filled with 20th century values, which are completely anachronistic to the time when the plot happenes. For example, there is a protest against Child Labor in China, which makes you wanna shout that even in the U.S and China there was child labor these days, so what's the point of putting it in. It feels as if the writer insults the viewer's intelligence by making his messages as clear as can be, and the credibility of the plot pays for it.The design of the characters is another problem. Jo is very feminine in this movie and hardly remind the book. Her famous exclamation "Christopher Colombus!" is replaced here by a weak "By Jehosafat"(?). The mother is presented like a hard person. The movie gets lost between the sisters and there is a feeling that none of the sisters get, eventually, enough attention.In conclusion, I think it's a badly written and talentlessly directed movie. I think it's a misinterpretation of the book, caused by a desparate try to be original and a lousy attempt to make the book "understood" for the modern person, as if anything that was written before 1990 is beyond our grasp. Thus, it ignores the fact that great litrature is timeless and eternal.	16
620	I love this movie! One of my all time favorites. But when I first watched it, started freezing up so had to take out and cleaned it. Than I put it back in and now it works perfect!	2
621	The Bottom Line:As a 20 year old male I was not expecting to be won over by this film, but it's an engaging story and was simply well-made; it's not perfect, and Eric Stolz looks completely out of place in the 19th century, but it's an enjoyable movie.	6
622	So this film is not as good as the book or earlier Little Women films, however, it is clean, touching, and well made.	6
623	The most interesting thing about the three film versions of "Little Women" is comparing them to each other or comparing each of them to Alcott's book.What makes them so difficult to choose between is that the casting of the four title characters is the critical element, and each film featured at least one actress whose performance was clearly superior to her character's portrayal in the other two films.This all star cast would include Jean Parker (Beth) in the 1933 version, Janet Leigh (Meg) in the 1949 version, and Winona Ryder (Jo) in the 1994 version. The 1994 version also had the best Amy, if only because they wisely split the role into a younger Amy (Kirsten Dunst) and an older Amy (Samantha Mathis).Since Jo is pretty clearly the most important of the four sisters (to the story), the 1994 version gets my nod as the best of the three films. The 1933 version pulls in as a close second as Joan Bennett and Katherine Hepburn are the second best Amy and Jo; and Francis Dee's Meg is as good as Trini Alvarado's. Neither Margaret O'Brien nor Claire Danes come even close to Parker's portrayal of Beth.The biggest casting problem all the productions had was in the age of the actresses. With the exception of Beth, all three characters must span a five year period. The casting process typically addressed this by selecting older actresses and getting them to play (with varying degrees of success) much (June Allyson was 32 years old) younger versions of themselves during the first half of the film.At least the 1994 versions managed to get the birth order right. The 1933 version had some problems in this area, as Hepburn was two years older than Dee and Bennett five years older than Parker. While this still causes many Alcott fans to cringe, it is nothing compared to the 1949 version where Allyson was ten years older than Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor was five years older than O'Brien.Taylor should have played Jo, which would have saved viewers from Allyson's embarrassing portrayal and from Taylor's attempt to pass as a blonde. Few actresses (even in black and white) were less suited to a light hair color. While Taylor's portrayal of Amy is painful, she would have been well suited to the Jo role.Critics frequently point out that both Hepburn and Allyson were much like Jo in real life, so there is a certain irony that Ryder's portrayal of the character (one so dissimilar to herself) was far superior. But Ryder and Jo have a similar level of intensity so maybe it was not as much a stretch as it seems.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.	2
624	I actually like this dramatization better than the original film starring Katharine Hepburn as Jo. I am a huge fan of the book but I give film the privilege of dramatic license to change things to make it work better. I definitely would recommend this film to those who not overly loyal to the film. If you are a die-hard book fan the 1930,s version is a better choice.	6
625	A timeless classic.  I have several versions.  This version being equal to the classics and my daughter's favorite version.	3
626	So, everything I ordered was handled well, on time and in perfect condition! I would purchase from this sight again.	6
627	I think it's a very well done movie, with great actors..I love the period and how they captured their lives in such a true spirit.	6
628	Because it is a classic story, one that every generation loves and the actresses you play the parts do an outstanding job.	6
629	Love the family relationship between the sisters. They portray a very close knit family and the closeness they have or one another. I good family film to teach children to be kind to their siblings.	6
630	I got it for my 11 y.o. girls since she just finished the book. We both enjoyed it so much!	6
631	I was fortunate to recently have seen both the 1949 version and then this modern adaptation a short time apart. The first time I saw this version I liked it well enough; however, after seeing the 1949 version and then watching this one again, I was reminded how superior the former version is in both cast and content.I didn't find myself identifying nearly as strongly with the characters as I did in the older films. Here we have a waif-like Winona Ryder, who portrays a delicate, frail-looking, and far-too-feminine version of Jo. Counter these distinct contrasts with June Allyson's rough and tumble, tomboyish portrayal of Jo that was much closer to the book for accuracy. (In the novel, Jo is described as 'very tall' with 'big hands and feet' and coltish in appearance). The only thing the fictional Jo has in common with Winona is brown hair.Susan Sarandon is a great actress in her own right, but for some reason she overwhelms the role of Marmee. All I could see here was "Susan Sarandon". I think a lesser-known actress may have been more effective here. Mary Astor's performance in the older movie seemed more believable. Not that Sarandon doesn't act sincere or warm, but she seems somehow miscast anyhow.One especially notable difference is that Margaret O'Brien's portrayal of Beth in the 1949 version is much stronger and more heart-rending than Claire Danes' modern interpretation; Danes makes Beth appear whiny or as another reviewer noted, possibly even dim-witted. This Beth wasn't a particularly sympathetic character. I never felt her character was developed enough to be interesting. Another reviewer noted that Danes has that big strapping farm girl look, which doesn't mesh with the book's image of a frail and fragile Beth. I agree. Danes' pinched, flared-nostril expressions are strange and at times downright scary.There are some other diversions from the original text and older movies that make this version a paler shadow. There are the laughable injections of politically-correct speeches and feminist rants that other reviewers have noted, but the real travesty I thought was in completely omitting the very special relationship between the grandfatherly Mr. Laurence and Beth.In the book this unfolds as the terribly shy Beth is coaxed over time to go over and practice her music on the grand piano in the elder Mr. Laurence's house. By way of thanks, Beth knits the lonely old gent a pair of house slippers, which he later returns a gift in kind in the form of the beautiful piano. He asks her to play it and keep alive the memory of the little granddaughter he lost. It's a heart-wrenching scene in the book and earlier films.Yet in his version, the piano simply appears as a surprise joint Christmas gift from the whole family to Beth with no explanation, and that special relationship between Mr. Laurence and Beth is never truly acknowledged or shown. I feel this is an example of one of the sadder oversights of this version of "Little Women".It's true there is artistry in the scenery and the costumes, but the special magic or chemistry is missing from this film. I suspect the miscasting of major roles has much to do with it, but if you can enjoy the movie without looking for authenticity to the book, it's still a fine way to while away an afternoon.	12
632	I saw the Elizabeth Taylor, June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Margaret O'Brien version when I was a "litle woman" and fell in love with its magic. So I was a little hesitant to see this up-date, lest it spoil the memories for me.I was basically pleased. The cinematography was terrific---I was glad to see the beautiful snowy Christmas scenes, still old-fashionedly wonderful!  I didn't care for the update in terms of the feminist lingo. Why?  Don't we already know these things?  Well, when they put it in terms of Transcendentalism, it made more sense.The cast was uniformly good.  Susan Sarandon brought warmth to the character as well as principle.  The young Kirsten Dunst was totally delightful and stole every scene she was in.  The actress who played her older version looked a great deal like her but had none of her bubbly joyfulness---had living in Paris dulled her spirit?  Unlikely!  I found Claire Danes' performance quite remarkable and wished that we had seen more of her.Christian Bale seeme a little too smart for his age but he was a suitable companion for Winona Ryder as Jo.  Her performance as the young Jo was more bratty than high-spirited, which I found dismaying. I was actually glad when her manuscript was thrown in the fire!  When she got to New York, though, she seemed to sweeten up and was more sympathetic. She certainly looked good. The German professor was charming but seemed so much older than she was that I found it hard to believe that she'd fall in love with him.However, in sum, this is a very nice, old-fashioned, heart-felt movie, certainly worth watching.	2
633	Having loved the book as a girl and enjoyed the earlier film versions, I had high expectations for this remake. Sadly, those expectations were dashed. I didn't have as much of a problem with the movie departing from the text, because I believe that movies always interpet the books which inspired them anyway. My objection pertains to the degree or extent of interpretation. What I disliked most about this remake was its unrelenting preachiness and the ahistorical way it projected 1990's values into the past. I thought the book was feminist and modern in its own context, and so its variant of strong womanhood should have been honored on its own terms rather than devalued by reinterpreting it in our terms, while still locating the story in the past. In so doing, this movie implied that the best, the only valid, and the most enlightened feminism is the one we know today. That's just plain old conceit.	18
634	Just a side note on this film if you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while...Laurie is played by Batman. Christian Bale.	6
635	This is one of my favorite books and the movie does it justice. The &#34;dream-team&#34; of actors practically guarentees this movie to be a great succes...and it is. It's up there in the annals of classic Christmas films, as far as I'm concerned. The soundtrack is beautiful as well as the set and costumes.  This is one I watch with my daughter and grand-daughter.	1
636	I found this movie version of story Little Women to be one of the best ones done so far. I was very plesaed the director was able to find actors who fit the parts so perfectly. In other versions of this movie I was disapointed when the directors used just any actor who wasn't perfect for the part they were trying to play. There were some parts of the movie that didn't correspond with the book Little Women however they made up for it with the vividness of the backround the costumes. The people themselves actually looked like they were born in that time period instead of just fitting in. I like the fact that the wirters spent a little more time expressing the romance between Amy and Laure then the book it self did. The movie it self seemed more like real life than just something you were watching on telivision.	1
637	I love this movie.  I have seen at least 30 times and have nearly all the words memorized.  I thought all the actors did a wonderful job.  I have read the book and they did change a few things and of course as in all  movie adaptations cut a few parts out but I don't care.  I love every part  of this movie especially the scene withe the &quot;burnt feathers&quot;,  the part when amy burns Jo's book, and when Jo is reading John Brooke's  proposal and she gets that funny look on her face.  I also loved the music  and own the CD	1
638	I like to watch this whenever in a sentimental mood...plus the acting is superb. Don't miss it.	6
639	The 1994 version of &quot;Little Women&quot; stars Winona Ryder in an  Oscar nominated performance.  This film also co-stars Susan Surandon,  Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, Claire Danes, and Kirstin Dunst.  The star  power alone in this film makes it worth watching!  This film is faithful to  the book &quot;Little Women,&quot; by  Louisa May Alcott, which it is based  on.  I have seen &quot;Little Women&quot; dozens of times and I highly  recommend it, especially to families, children, and women of all ages.  Byrne and Bale are both romantic and unforgettible and the lasting love and  affection between the March sisters is endearing. The film takes place  during the Civil War, which the father is off fighting.  This leaves Marmee  to raise their four &quot;little women,&quot; conservative Meg, impetuous  Jo, who longs to be a writer, fragile Beth, and romantic Amy, who desires  to be an artist and marry a wealthy man. Marmee guides them in generosity,  independence, virtue and romance.  The sisters share their most cherised  and painful memories growing up.  &quot;Little Women&quot; is a feel good  movie with heartfelt emotion and humor, well worth buying and watching  again and again.	3
640	Deep down inside many women, there is a person who wishes she lived in a simpler time. When people tied letters in ribbons, took cooking, sewing, knitting and quilting seriously and men brought women flowers. Yes, that still all happens today, but somehow some of us dream of the romance of the era. A time, long gone, as we rush towards the future.No time for a tea party, dressing up in lace, wearing gloves. How about finding time to sit on a park bench and steal a kiss? Then there are those wonderful attics, filled with mementos and treasures, just waiting to be discovered. Well, at least we can find time to escape into a movie and live the daydream through the characters. I have never had a sister, but when watching this movie, I always think how wonderful it would have been to have had a sister.To provide some background for this movie: Little Women was written in 1868 and the story takes place during the early 1860's. Many Americans were moving Westward and women like Jo March in this story, embraced the changes as they rode the wave into the new future. Because men had to go off to war (Civil War 1861-1865), women became more self-reliant and Marmee (Jo's Mother) represents a woman who faces the challenge with dignity and resolve. She is determined to make life wonderful for her family.Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was ahead of her time. Her main ambition in life was to relieve her family of financial heartache and Jo also strives for this in Little Women. Her writing talents eventually did help to support her family. When her Boston publisher suggested she should write a story for girls, she decided to try the experiment. The girls she knew best were herself and her three sisters, so she based her book on her family and created Jo March as her own fictional counterpart.Like Louisa, Jo struggles to conceal her strong-willed nature in a time when women were much more docile. She is the real Jo march. Anna (Meg) is Louisa's older sister. Elizabeth (Beth) was ill for two years before she died in 1858. May (Amy) became a painter in Paris and actually illustrated the first edition of Little Women in 1868. Abba (Marmee) is Louisa's mother who understood her daughter and encouraged her to be all she could be.Bronson Alcott, Louisa's father had a vision for an ideal world, but often he tended to ignore the realities of life. In this movie, he goes off to war and is injured.In Concord, Massachusetts, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne helped to kindle Louisa's ambitious nature. She was the first woman registered to vote in Concord, Massachusetts. The March family home in the story is actually the Alcotts Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts where the family lived for 20 years.There are two versions of this story that have been brought to the screen most wonderfully, in my own opinion. I have not seen all the movies made, but think perhaps if they were all combined into one, the perfect movie will have been created. There are quite a few details left out of this one that I really missed. Some should be in this movie to give it more depth and were included in the 1949 movie.This version of 1994 and the 1949 movie are my absolute favorites. To know the full story, you must watch both. If you also read the book, you can fill in the tidbits that are not included.The story begins in winter when there are to be no presents for Christmas and a family in need is blessed by the March family giving them their entire breakfast. The women in this story are like angels, they strive to be good and have such great character.This movie is delightfully filled with kittens, fall leaves, books, lace gloves, romantic letters, snow, opera, art and tea parties. It is truly the most beautiful adaptation of the classic story. The New England countryside around Concord is incredible in the Autumn. The seasons change as the characters lives evolve and as life moves on.Jo is the main character and has a mind of her own, we follow her story as she finds out who she really is and what she wants from life. She occasionally seems to burst from her quietness with such exuberance for life. She would have been quite happy running off to war and is a bit of a tomboy, but seems just quite modern to women today. She is so unaware of her own deep desires (except wanting to be published) until she experiences losses that bring her to a new understanding of her own need for love.The four sisters have such fun at home acting out the stories Jo writes, that their neighbor Laurie wants to join their society. He is infatuated with Jo, but she only feels a love of friendship for him.When Jo leaves to go to N.Y. she meets a more mature man who intrigues her. She shares her love of writing with him until one day he slightly criticizes her work and deeply hurts her when he says: "There is more to you than this, if you have the courage to write it." We think that perhaps Jo will never grow up and find love.Will Jo ever find what she is looking for and will she be a successful writer? If you are looking for a movie that is perfect for winter viewing, this will warm your heart! If you love this movie, you must also see Gone with the Wind.Watch this movie at night with candles. Oh, and have some oranges close by. ;>~The Rebecca Review	9
641	I am suprised at the diversity of reactions to this movie, though I should not be. This was one of my absolute favorite movies, growing up. My sisters and I watched it over and over, and never got tired of it. I agree with some of the more critical reviewers that some of they key relationships and ideas from Miss Alcotts novel were definately missing in this movie, however. There are, I believe, two reasons for this: 1) A two hour show can only show so much (epsecially if your priority is to get the kissing scenes in there), and 2) Some of the main ideas (i.e. Christianity as the MAIN reason for the developing of one's charactor, ect;) were basically left out so as not to make the people's thinking seem outmoded to modern viewers. That is too bad, but it is still one of the best movies I have ever seen. The filming, acting, music, and setting are beautiful, and convincing. I cry almost every time I watch this. Anyone who has sisters they love would do the same.	10
642	This movie is soooo heartwarming!!  Could watch over snd over again!  It has just the right amount of everything!  Romance, Sadness, Sillyness, and everything else.  Wonderful movie! :)	6
643	One star for Winona Ryder, one star for Susan Sarandon, one star for Claire Danes; subtract one for Gillian Armstrong.Gillian Armstrong has directed brilliant films before, and not just by title, so my expectations for this film were quite high, and I was sorely disappointed. What was this film about? These women love each other? Well, we knew that after the first four minutes, and left after was pretty sets, period costumes, and an oscar quality score.It's all very nice and wrapped in a pretty bow, but Jo's speeches about feminism and women's place in the world seem like frayed edges someone forget to trim.I can't help wondering whether in the early production stage, an associate remembered the cheering crowd at Cannes in 1979, after the unexpected film My Brilliant Career, and thought &quot;Jo March is an American Sybylla Melvyn,&quot; then convinced the team to hire the director of My Brilliant Career to come to America and make Jo March's Brilliant Career.The parallels are really there; they are not imagined: the seemingly obvious and perfect marriage turned down. The autobiographical manuscript bundled and mailed with those small feminine hands. To defy or not to defy; to be born homely and clever... the actress who seems striking by our standards, but homely by the standards of the time of the film.And the undeniable talent of the starring actress. Winona Ryder has more than proved herself in the market, and among the critics.I have no idea why it didn't work. I can't help thinking that most of the blame rests squarely on the head of Gillian Armstrong, who seems to sleepwalk her way through the film. This picture has no stamp of art on it. The actresses are all working very hard, and in many cases rise so high above a merely adequate script, that it is too bad there is not a special Academy Award for this.It is unfortunate, but with so much potential, so much material to work with, the binding thread in this picture ends up being the pretty sets, and the well-designed period costumes. It is as though there is no director at all, but the actors memorized their lines at home in their bedrooms, came to the set, dressed, and made up the rest as the cameras rolled.Read the book instead.	12
644	although I love the movies of by-gone life, this has a beautiful story about how to cope with life that is not always what you thought it should be.	1
645	Absolutely wonderful movie that I and my teenage daughter loved sharing together.  I highly recommend for a nice bonding moment.	6
646	This lovely Christmas-colored movie transports you with its knowing performances and hugely entertaining series of romantic adventures.  There are melodramatic pitfalls, to be sure, but that is one of the pleasures of  Alcott's original book, and certainly what makes it endlessly enjoyable.  Susan Sarandon is fresh and vital as Marmie, a mother for the ages, and  each child brings to her role a sharp, colorful portrayal that stays with  you.  Christian Bale is perfectly cast as Laurie -- there is not one  performance that does not move you with precision and dignity. The score is  lovely and delivers emotionally -- there are many, many moments in this  film that earn tears, followed by warm smiles.  This is one for everyone in  the entire family.	1
647	The movie of "Little women" is heartwarming, full of family adventures in life - touching, exciting, encouraging.  Family values shine and give a good example of how we should live our lives and it is applicable for today.Little Women (Collector's Series)- Get your popcorn and those you love and ENJOY.	6
648	I watched this delightful period movie on tv and when it was over , I wanted to buy the DVD. I thought about amazon  and found just what I was looking for at avery good price. It took about 10 days or so and I recieved it in the mail in good condition. I'm very happy and I will do bussiness again.	6
649	I am very pleased with my DVD I wanted. It is one of my favorite movies and am happy to have it on DVD.	6
650	This is an amazing movie! I would consider it to be a classical movie!	6
651	Although I've watched this movie several dozen times, I still have at least four hearty cries every time I watch it.  The acting is superb, and I love Ryder's portrayal of Jo (reluctant to let go of her girlhood and unhappy with the changes her family is undergoing). Christian Bale was wonderful as Laurie (though with him as Laurie, it's hard to understand Jo's romantic rejection of him :-) This movie is a modern gem.  The soundtrack (which can be isolated from the DVD) is very beautiful as well.	4
652	&quot;Little Women&quot; has been in my collection ever since it was released on DVD. It is a timeless tale of the March family, brought closer together by their father off fighting in the Civil War. Jo, Beth, Amy and Meg are unusual for their time: they are liberal. Jo is a writer and an amateur actress and would &quot;kill to go to Havard.&quot; Amy is an artist who later studies in Europe. Meg stays close to home, as does Beth, the angelic, sickly saint, always concerned with the welfare of the poor and disadvantaged, thinking of others first and herself last.The cinematography is beautiful in &quot;Little Women,&quot; although only a few scenes were shot in Massachussetts, the majority of the film actually being shot in British Colombia. The costumes, habits of the time (corsets, sleeping with rags in the hair to keep curls in, baked potatoes as pocket warmers) and houses take us back to a distant time when life was simpler in some ways. The story of the &quot;little women&quot; is a timeless classic that teaches love, tolerance, and the importance of following dreams.The DVD comes packed with a making-of documentary, commentary by director Gillian Armstrong, deleted scenes with director's commentary, isolated music score (the soundtrack to &quot;Little Women&quot; is simply gorgeous and worthy of many listens), a costume and production design gallery, two trivia games and a historical timeline. It is the ultimate DVD packaging of one of my favourite novels from childhood (next to &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; of course).	2
653	I grew up reading classic literature, and Little Women had always been a favorite. This movie brings beloved characters to life. The acting is perfect; the March family is just as I had envisioned them. A great movie to make you laugh (and possibly cry)!	6
654	Great mother/daughter movie for a tween ager or older. Not too long but gets the highlights of the book. Enjoy!	6
655	Classic movie. wonderful to watch around Christmas with your family. good values and a great look back into our nation's simple and historic past.	6
656	Little women was a great movie to watch and a great lesson about a families love and each and every person is different.  It was mostly about Joe's life and how just because she was more adventurous then the other girls i irl.  She loved to write and explore the world herself.  She did things that made her wonder t caused her life to be a bit more confusing.  It is set in the early 1900's so they believed girls were suppose to stay home and be a house wife.  Joe was not that kind of g about herself. She was a loving and caring sister who would do anything for her family.  Family was the one thing she was sure about. It took a lot of heartbreak and life experiences to teach this girl what life was really about. After her two sisters got married and she inherited a house to big for herself, she realized she too had to start looking forward to life.  Joe was also a wonderful writer.  She dreamed of writing a novel and she never could get her dream accomplished.  She finally started remembering her childhood and the perfect novel came to her. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in movies about life in the early 1900's and who enjoy a warm-heart movie about family.  This movie is great for a school lesson or a family movie.  It makes you laugh it makes you cry and even makes you mad at a few things.	3
657	Every once in awhile there comes a movie that touches you and makes you feel good for having seen it. For me that movie is Little Women. I have never read the book before and I had never seen some sort of other movie adaptation. So when I approached Little Women I was a little skeptical of it being a sappy "chick flick" that I would hate. Of course it was a "chick flick" but I didn't really hate it. In fact I enjoyed it but there were things that annoyed me. Mostly it was the character of Jo (Winona Ryder). From what I have read she is supposed to be "fiery", but I think she came off as whiney and annoying. Winona played Jo well but I think that the character is lame. The other actors did a great job playing their parts but I thought that the young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) was a little unrealistic at some points. The movie is basically about the growing up of a small New England family during the Civil War period. It shows the characters from when they are about teens until they grow up and get married. Of course during this time period many things happen that test the will of all of the characters and threatens to split everyone up. I would hate to give anything away since this movie is great. It isn't difficult to follow and the characters (for the most part) are loveable. You feel all of the happiness and sadness as they go through their lives. This is a great movie, but there are some small flaws here and there that hinder it quite a bit. I would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.	2
658	This movie is absolutely wonder and I can watch it over and over!! This movie is a classic and I wouldn't change anything about it.	6
659	Was great I loved it on a great story and a lot of hard I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the classic!	6
660	I wanted to order this movie as a little Christmas gift for myself, and I am amazingly disappointed that it is currently not available! There's nothing better on a winter's night--or any night, for that  matter--than a  mug of hot chocolate, a warm pair of slippers, and Little Women in the VCR.  I have gotten all of my roommates hooked! We rent it on a regular basis  whenever we have spare time between final exams or term papers. Winona  Ryder was deserving of the Oscar nomination she received for her portrayal  of Jo! As a matter of fact, all of the actors were outstanding! Having read  the book numerous times since I was a child, I find myself even  more  captivated by the movie! (How often is that possible! )  The score is pure  magic. The colors are rich. The details are superb. While I'm usually not  one for movies that end up with everyone living happily ever after in an  all-too-convenient way, Little Women makes me feel content with its loving  ending, rather than cynical. An especially good film for children.	9
661	Don't waste your money or your time on this HORRIBLE remake of a wonderful film.  This movie is an insult to Louisa May Alcott.  The story does not even follow the book, the acting is terrible, the casting is terrible, and the character study is non-existent.  I won't even add this to my collection, and I have no one I would want to give this to.  It's just that bad.  Pathetic, absurd, boring and emotionless.  Avoid it.	17
662	I was so excited to purchase my copy of this film because it's one of my favorites.  But it won't play.  It won't play in any American DVD player.  That's something that should have been advertised.	6
663	if one was to compare katharine hepburn to winona ryder, the results would be obvious. the book isn't supposed to be a feminist account, it's supposed to be a civil war tale of a family. since it's so modern, and the acting and even the colors are modern, we never feel the full experience, or that we are in the 1800's. In the 1933 version we feel a part of the family. This is less than inspiring. how clare danes became Beth, i'll never know, what Kirsten dunst is doing here is a mystery. Although SUsan Sarandon is fine, she is the best thing in here, but nowhere near spring bryington. Christian bale is too dreamy, and his and winia'a chemisrty isn't right. it doesn't follow the book, and the cast is miscast. I don't recommend, instead watch the beautifully done 1933 CLASSIC, or even the 1949 one with June Allyson and Margaret O'brien. Skip this.	39
664	This version of Alcott's classic story is luminescent, brilliantly acted, perfectly staged, and far more emotional than the book.Katharine Hepburn's Jo, six decades earlier, was hard to top, but Winona Ryder does it -- with sensitivity, more believable passion, and a far more expressive face. Ryder's Jo is entirely believable in her plunging into writing with reckless abandon, more so than Hepburn, for whom it took second place to love. Yet, paradoxically, the romance is far more believable for the newer Jo when it does come along.Everyone else in the story reflects her struggles and triumphs, and it's a stellar ensemble cast. Especially adept are Trini Alvarado, a conflicted and beautiful Meg; Claire Danes, trembling and heartbreaking as Beth; Christian Bale, giving a raucous edge to next-door Laurie; and most of all, Gabriel Byrne, a younger-by-15-years Prof. Bhaer, finally made both believable and romantic.All actors portray the same character throughout except for Kirsten Dunst and Samantha Mathis, who assay Amy at ages 12 and 17. Others have criticized this casting, but it worked well for me, especially in the older Amy taking her propriety and &quot;finishing&quot; far more seriously than it deserved.The story does depart slightly from the book, but not from Alcott, and the film is better for it -- certainly less precious and affected. A few plot elements from &quot;Little Men&quot; and later books flesh out this story, and Alcott's own attitudes about empowering women are brought into Susan Sarandon's quietly powerful Marmee. The Alcott family's intellectual interests inform Jo's stay in New York, adding some depth and grounding to her character and romantic feelings.This new DVD's features are a delight, especially in Gillian Armstrong's intense narration on the commentary track. She had a vision and depth of attention to this film's details that ought to be celebrated, yet rarely is for women directors. Outtakes are also narrated, a rarity. The making-of featurette and other elements are well-shaped, though Danes's behind-the-scenes program from HBO is not present, which is a bit disappointing.The transfers are crisp and clear, both video and audio. Thomas Newman's brilliant music can be heard on a separate audio track, and anyone who likes this film should watch it once with just his evocative (and often-imitated) score filling the ears.	4
665	My favorite book and movie around the holidays and always! The actors in this version make a difference. I always cme back to it at Christmas	6
666	The lovely sets and costumes make this a joy to watch.  And though there are some changes from the book it sticks pretty close to Alcott's story which I admittedly was obsessed with as a child.  I took one star off for Winona Ryder's performance since to me she was a bit too pretty and socially polished to be the Jo the book portrays.  Still this is a great movie for family viewing or for anyone who likes nostalgic movies set in the 19th century.	1
667	I loved this movie and have watched it over and over.  True to the book but better... How often does that happen?	6
668	This is a great movie (from a great book)! My daughter loves to watch it and talk about the characters. It's so nice to see a movie of quality.	6
669	Modern version of Little Women. Susan Serandon is always enjoyable on the screen. Wynona Ryder was enjoyable as Jo. All the actresses were likable.	6
670	Have the originalwith Hepburn now this one .Both  Ryder is very good so I enjoy it as well but  Jo will  always be best characterizes by Kate Hepburn.	6
671	I'd really like to give this movie 3.5 stars because it was flawed yet I did enjoy it. The scenery and costumes were gorgeous and the movie is definitely loaded with plenty of emotion and heartfelt family moments. On top of this, the soundtrack is beautiful and entirely appropriate for the unfolding events.I will admit that I didn't like this movie much the first time I watched  it, and it was definitely something that grew on me. I think this is because the movie was not really an accurate depiction of the book. Other than the overly feministy nature of the movie, I also felt like some of the casting just didn't seem to be quite right. I think the character of Meg was okay because she was physically pretty and was accurately depicted as being somewhat vain (although she could have been more so), and the character of Beth was also accurately depicted as being shy and sickly, however I don't think Claire Danes was physically dainty/fragile enough for the role. As for the other two sisters, I felt like Amy was depicted very well by Kirsten and also by the other actress; she was selfish and wanted to be pampered. The character of Jo is the one I'm most unsure of. While Winona's Jo did have a temper and was a little fiesty, I felt that she could have been fiestier and more tomboy-ish. She also seemed to be a bit too reserved at times as well.Also, I was a little disappointed with the way character growth was portrayed in this movie; it felt rushed and sporadic, not like character growth should be. For example, Amy starts out as a selfish little girl but becomes a better person as she gets older and we see none of this transition in the movie. One day she's one way, and the next day she's a completely different person. Maybe they should have made the movie longer to do this better and maybe a longer movie would have prevented the omission of certain critical scenes in the book that were left out of the movie (like the first conversation the sisters have which really emphasizes the differences in their personalities).So overall, I would say this is a good movie if you don't compare or expect it to be too much like the book. Accept that it's different and you just might grow to like it like I did.	1
672	This movie, Little Women had me so hooked from the moment I pressed play on my dvd remote. After seeing Christian in A Mid-Summer Night's Dream,Velvet Goldmine, and Shaft, I became a true believer that he is one of the most brilliant, sexy, most underrated actors that I've ever seen. In Little Women, he captured my heart, soul,and he just plain took my breath away. I have not been so taken with a romantic performance by a male since Richard Chamberlain, in The Thorn Birds! Christian is so handsome,charming,and romantic as "Laurie",that I just melted when he got his heart broken by Jo, I screamed at the t.v., Are you blind! You've got to get this movie for the holidays, it's perrrrfect.	6
673	It was nice to be able to download it and watch it the night before the assignment was due! She liked the movie!	6
674	A very beautiful story full of laughs, tragedy , romance and struggles and the occasional triumph over the odds in that day and age.	6
675	Little Women is one of my favorite movies.  I thought it was time I bought my own copy.  For me this movie is a must see at Christmastime !	6
676	Condition as discribed.  In good mailer and DVD of Little Women is very good.  Would use this seller again.	2
677	***WARNING: I HAVE INCLUDED A SPOILER BELOW***This is one of the sweetest movies I have ever seen. I am a guy and I loved it. I have to admit that Claire Danes' (Beth) death scene is probably the saddest scene I  have ever seen in a movie. Very good performances by Winona Ryder and  Danes. Recommended.	5
678	Watch this every year at Christmas  time, very heartwarming.  Continue to enjoy year after year.  The ultimate family movie for everyone.	6
679	This is the best version of Little Women ever made into film.  The cast makes you believe they really are the March family and the film is a joy to watch from begining to end and is a must have.	1
680	This runs reasonably true to the book but important parts are left out, such as Beth and Mr. Lawrence having a special bond, which leaves one confused as to why he gives her a piano.  Also, the money problems Meg and John have are completely left out.  In fact, both characters are superficial and almost tangent to the story. Marmee is presented as an arbitrary shrew who always seems too busy to pay attention to her family.  The movie doesn't flow very well, and is rather boring at certain times.  The characters kiss in public, which would have been unthinkable in the Victorian era.  There is a scene in which Laurie and Amy are in a coach that is downright creepy.Much of the acting is terrible, Winona Ryder is way too feminine acting and not strong willed enough to be a convincing Jo.  However, this is overshadowed by the horrid job Claire Danes does in portraying Beth. She is the worst Beth I have ever seen, and I have both the 1933 and 1949 versions.  She comes off as healthy and active, and indeed, has an almost tomboy quality about her. It's hard to cry when she dies, because she seems like she could jump out of the bed and run a mile.All in all, this is simply a modern version of a classic that frankly, it does not do justice to.  Don't waste your time on it.	3
681	Even though my husband fell asleep while watching Little Women with me, I love this movie!  He's boring, and falls asleep easily anyways. :)	6
682	My granddaughter had just read the book.  She watched the movie and loved it.  Great picture for children that are past the cartoon stage.	6
683	A delightful, well-acted film that stays true to the spirit of the novel Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.  One really doesn't want the movie to end!	1
684	Faithful to the book.  Christian Bale is wonderful as Laurie and the relationship between the sisters and Marmee is spot on.	6
685	"I Loved This Movie", this and older versions. This being my favorite by far. Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon give heart-warming performances! This is a must see Christmas "Chick Flick". My daughter and I have watched this many times together!!!	6
686	I LOVE this version of the movie, watch it at least 3 times every Christmas....a keeper for sure.	6
687	This movie has always held great memories for me and to get it on my computer and my kindle fire with such clarity I am hooked. Thank you for such great technology and giving me the memories that are the fondest to me. The movie itself is such a good movie every aspect is so wonderful.	6
688	From the book to the movie and to the rewrites and updated movie all the way to the audio book..... I truly enjoy this classic work of literature!The Complete Little Women Series: Little Women, Good Wives, Little Men, Jo's Boys (4 books in one)	6
689	The book is good but I really enjoyed this version of the movie. There are several out there but this cast imarticular with Wynona Ryder, Susarandon, Christain Bale, Eric Stoltz just a great cast and awesome acting to say the  least. I also bought the sound tract, you must too!	1
690	I watched this movie when I was young, and I still enjoy watching it. I love Christian Bale, without him, this movie may not have been what it was.	6
691	Beautiful, Heartwarming. Absolutely loved the movie.  It will become a Christmas tradition around our home (good to watch at other times, too!)	6
692	Basically, I went through my box of vhs tapes and realized there were a bunch of wonderful movies that we needed in cd format so we could enjoy them, again!  Best place for taking care of such a task is ... coming to Amazon.com!  Service was great!	1
693	This was a Christmas present for one of my daughters.  She enjoyed it very much.  She should since it was what she asked Santa for.	6
694	If you're a purist, you'll probably scoff at this 1994 movie adaptation of the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott. It is not a faithful adaptation, and a rather modernized version. But having said that, I love this adaptation all the same because of the wonderful acting by the ensemble cast.The movie tells the story of a New England family during the Civil War - there's Marmie [Susan Sarandon, my favorite Marmie of all the adaptations],Meg, Jo [Winona Ryder who actually really shines in this role], Beth [Claire Danes], and Amy. Dad is a Union Army Chaplain and away on the battleground and so the band of women fend for themselves. Their lack of material comforts is never seen as much of a problem [they portray a once-prosperous family fallen on hard times] and then there's next door neighbor Laurie [an utterly charming Christian Bale]who becomes infatuated with the strong-willed Jo.The acting is this movie adaptation is perhaps one of the finest if taken as an ensemble performance - all the actors shine in their roles, especially Sarandon as Marmie, Ryder as Jo, Danes as the ethereal and fragile Beth, Bale as Laurie, and of course, Gabriel Byrne as Prof. Bhaer. The sets, costumes and cinematography are absolutely beautiful and so is the beguiling score.I make it a point to watch the movie adaptations of Little Women once a year - these movies just make me feel good and happy, especially during the holidays. Highly recommended to fans of Little Women and period dramas.	6
